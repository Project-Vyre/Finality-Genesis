Health Fix","description":"Fixes a bug with max health in Minecraft.","body":"<p>This mod fixes an <a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-17876\" rel=\"nofollow\">old bug</a> in Minecraft that causes the \"Max Health\" attribute to be ignored when a player joins the game. This bug will cause players with a health value greater than the default limit of 20 to be reset back down to 20 when they join the game. For example if the player is wearing a helmet that gives them +10 max health and they leave the game while having 25 health their health will be reset back to 20 when they rejoin the game.</p>\n<p>This mod can be installed on the client and server. When installed on the client the bug will be fixed for your singleplayer worlds. When installed on the server the bug will be fixed for all players playing on the server, even those without the mod installed on their client.</p>\n\n<p>You can test this bug using the following steps.</p>\n<p>1. Create a new world with cheats enabled and creative mode turned off.<br>2. Use the /give command to give yourself a helmet with +10 max health. <strong>/give @p diamond_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"generic.max_health\",Amount:20.0,Slot:head,Name:\"generic.max_health\",UUID:[I;-12158,12468,122112,-24936]}]} 1<br></strong>3. Equip the helmet. Your max health should go from 20 to 30 (15 hearts).<br>4. Heal the player causing their health to be over 20.<br>5. Save the game and exit.<br>6. Rejoin the game.<br>7. Your health will be reset to 20. If the mod is installed it will not be.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

All code is open source and documented.\n\nIf you have any questions about the mod, please check the FAQ page, as your question is likely answered there. [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blue-skies/pages/faq](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blue-skies/pages/faq)\n\n## 🏷️ Welcome to Blue Skies: Population\n\nThe long awaited update is finally here! Population is a huge update to Blue Skies that adds tons of new blocks, items, biomes, mobs, and 2 new dungeons! Please come and join our Discord server to learn more! [https://discord.gg/WGfqqrG](https://discord.gg/WGfqqrG). This isn’t all however, even more dungeons and content will come soon!\n\n## 🔷 What is Blue Skies?\n\n**Blue Skies adds two dimensions called the Everbright and the Everdawn**. It includes lots of new unique features, blocks, weapons, mobs and even massive dungeons! Each dimension has its own theme, with the Everbright being very bright, snowy and cold while the Everdawn is typically darker and warm. Each of these dimensions currently has two dungeons to explore, totaling up to **4 dungeons**, with more planned on the way!\n\n## ✔️ Getting Started\n\n**I want to play! How do I install Blue Skies?** To get started, make sure that you have downloaded the latest version of the mod and you are running at least the recommended version of Forge to your Minecraft client. Alternatively, You can also easily install Blue Skies using the **new CurseForge launcher**, if you don’t have that installed already. Download it here: [https://download.curseforge.com/](https://download.curseforge.com/). Then, you can [click here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blue-skies/pages/installing-blue-skies) to view a guide on how to install Blue Skies with CurseForge launcher.\n\n## 🔑 The Gatekeeper\n\n**Find the Gatekeeper and trade a book in exchange for his journal.** **You can find the houses spawning in either plains, mountains, and most snowy biomes**. The Gatekeeper has extensive knowledge on these dimensions and has written all about the blocks, mobs, and dungeons found within to help guide you on your journey. You can also trade for a Zeal Lighter that works on both the Everbright and Everdawn portal frames. Check around their home as they have an unlit portal frame somewhere. As you progress through the mod, other trades may become available, so it’s worth checking his offers after reaching certain milestones.\n\n![Gatekeeper](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/304206170231420062-06-07-2021-1623119313.jpg)\n\n## 🕳️ How to Enter the Dimensions\n\n**Once you have found the Gatekeeper**, be sure to trade emeralds for the Zeal Lighter to be able to light one of the portal frames. He keeps an unlit Everbright or Everdawn portal stored somewhere in his home that you can use. Once you find the portal, tidy it up, give it a light, and it should open a door to its respective dimension.\n\n## 📘 Blue Journal\n\n**The Blue Journal**, a book written by the Gatekeeper that’s filled with information discovered from his experiences in these dimensions. The more you progress through Blue Skies, the more pages you will unlock in the journal. You only need to obtain the blue journal item once. Afterwards, you can always find access to it by opening your inventory and clicking the tab on the right with the blue journal icon.\n\n![Blue Journal](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/664722268101495836-06-07-2021-1623119661.png)\n\n### 🔊 Accessibility Reader\n\n**When enabling the narrator in Minecraft**, which you can do in the accessibility settings, a speaker icon will be added to the book. Clicking this will make the narrator read the information on the page to you.\n\n![Reader](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/862325152830994103-06-20-2021-1624210956.png)\n\n### ❄️ Everbright\n\nThe Everbright is a realm of eternal day and frigid cold. Home to large beasts and ethereal mobs, you’ll need to keep an eye on your back as you traverse through this world. Be sure to watch out for snow storms that bring thick fog and more enemies than usual. As you explore, you’ll encounter the Summoner’s Blinding Dungeon and the new Nature Dungeon, home of the Starlit Crusher.\n\n![Everbright](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/948403581218452818-06-07-2021-1623119463.jpg)\n\n### 🌅 Everdawn\n\nThe Everdawn has its sun forever rising. With this being a much more humid and warm world, insects and reptiles flourish. Before entering, it’s worth preparing for poison and fire as many parts of this world may inflict those on you. Venture across this diverse landscape to uncover the Alchemist’s Blinding Dungeon and then the new Poison Dungeon, lair of the Arachnarch.\n\n![Everdawn](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/742573515409892634-06-07-2021-1623119462.jpg)\n\n## 📖 Dungeons - Meet the Bosses!\n\nBlue Skies is home to various bosses found within their respective dungeons. These bosses are designed for players looking for a challenge, so be sure to come prepared. If you find a dungeon that has already been conquered, attempting to activate the keystone will unlock trades with the Gatekeeper, allowing you to purchase the needed keys.\n\nThe bosses have been designed with multiplayer in mind, scaling up in difficulty with more players. Grab your friends and open the door to an epic battle!\n\nOnce you’ve defeated a boss, you may respawn it with the arc item obtained from it by using the arc on the keystone. Doing so will spawn the boss at a higher difficulty, which may result in better loot.\n\n## The Summoner and the Alchemist, rulers of the towers of both dimensions!\n\nThe two Blinding Dungeons found between both dimensions are home to the Summoner and the Alchemist. These bosses were balanced with mid-tier armor and weapons in mind, allowing for an early combat experience should you accept the challenge.\n\nResiding in the Everbright, the Summoner fights with lightning, energy attacks, and his golem guards. Be sure to watch your back as these golems can quickly overwhelm you if not properly tended to. Defeating him will allow you to access the Nature Dungeon.\n\nFound in the Everdawn, the Alchemist uses potions and physical constructs to fight. Many of his attacks can be predicted by looking out for visual queues, but missing those queues may result in heavy damage. Once defeated, you’ll gain access to the Poison Dungeon.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvAG3_FE3_8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n![Blinding Towers](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/015385336242070865-06-07-2021-1623120053.jpg)\n\n## Meet the Starlit Crusher, the boss of the Nature Dungeon!\n\nThe Nature Dungeon is a massive labyrinth consisting of 4 floors. Each floor contains one of the required keys and a staircase up to the next floor. Be sure to check every nook and cranny and to not be overrun by the Stonlets living within.\n\nResting at the top of the Nature Dungeon, you’ll be met face to face with the Starlit Crusher. This sentient tree may not move much, but makes up for it by rooting into the ground to produce wide area attacks from below and enough brutal strength to cause the ground itself to shake. Seeing as it’s still a tree, axes deal far more damage against it and are required to bypass its defenses. Look out for opportunities to stun it with a spear for an opening to attack.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/frfMKbWWgeI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n![Nature Dungeon](https://cdn.moddinglegacy.com/807184440573786717-06-07-2021-1623120311.jpg)\n\n## The Arachnarch, the boss of the Poison Dungeon!\n\nThe Poison Dungeon is a large maze buried beneath the surface. On the surface, you’ll find a large, hollowed, maple tree covered in cobwebs. Made of 4 floors, you’ll need to find the key on each one and then descend to the next. Be sure not to lose your way in the spiders’ nest.\n\nLurking in the lowest depths of the Poison Dungeon, you’ll find the Arachnarch in her lair. This venomous foe lunges at targets and sprays poison from the ceiling above. Being the queen of this nest, expect reinforcements to come crawling from the walls.

Configure the options, keybinds and server list as you would like them to be shipped in the modpack\n2. Join any world and run \"/defaultoptions saveAll\" to save your current options in the defaultoptions folder (located in the config folder where it should remain)\n3. Do not include the options.txt and servers.dat from the root directory in your modpack\n4. Fresh installations (meaning no existing options.txt) will now start out with your default options\n\n**If you are using FoamFix Anarchy Version**, disable `B:initOptions` in the FoamFix config or else Default Options will not work. See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/blay09/DefaultOptions/issues/25) for more info.","published":"2022-06-14T21:15:45.532802Z","updated":"2023-09-27T06:50:33.879175Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":62165,"followers":39,"categories":["management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["J2H2vpLI","YN36x9Jb","nw9yrzag","jJxa5Gmc","HSWQDe7S","LlFwkgUx","9tmOVtry","Pb0E8WZN","Et9oI0rT","QSc3hlWR","aiy49T0Q","o32sAXGh","NdWk53Qq","h2fGLwAL","gUEpxWEe","iuGiPVsP","QIKpMBgZ","CKNINccT","n1N8gK1t","srYLHGmM","wRqU3JuA","64N7yejA","7P1WUDrG","ayHJIZRi","w9xvfauD","HYa1CJIc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WEg59z5b/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"wRqU3JuA","project_id":"WEg59z5b","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"15.0.2+forge-1.19","version_number":"15.0.2+forge-1.19","changelog":"-

alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n## 📖About 📖\n</center>\n\nJust Enough Effect Descriptions (JEED) is a JEI plugin that provides useful information regarding status effects.\n\nThe mod adds a new Effects recipe category accessed either by clicking any of the newly added status effect icons on the JEI item screen or by clicking an active effect from its box on the inventory screen.\n\nHere you'll be able to view information regarding such status effect such as items that can provide it or its description as well as which mod it's from or its effect color.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P8qv5ZN.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UfGgoGG.png)\n\n<center>\n\n## 🧪 Customization 🧪\n</center>\n\nThe mod automatically adds all registered status effect to its page, however modded effects won't had a description.\n\nModders can easily add such descriptions to their effect by adding the string `\"effect.[mod_id].[effect_name].description\"` to their language file.\n\nSince the mod can only automatically detect food items as effect providing ones, mod developers can also easily add support to their custom effect or effect providing items by adding some recipes into their mod.\n\nTo do so one can simply use one of the two newly added recipes categories:\n- \"jeed:effect_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can provide an effect in the following format:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:effect_provider\",\n  \"effect\":{\n    \"id\": \"minecraft:haste\"\n  },\n  \"providers\": [\n    {\n      \"item\": \"minecraft:beacon\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- \"jeed:potion_provider\", which allows one to specify an item that can contain any registered potion like tipped arrows for example:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"jeed:potion_provider\",\n

mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Enjoy playing in third person view. :)\n### Natural look and feel\nAttacks have an upswing phase before the hit is actually performed, like in real life.\n### Weapon combos\nSome weapons have a sequence of different attacks.\n### Dual wielding\nDual wield any one handed weapons! Use the attack hotkey to alternately attack with main-hand and off-hand.\n### Reworked Sweeping Edge\nWeapon swing hitting multiple enemies deal reduced damage. To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility. However, mods trying to change the same mechanics will never be compatible (such as dual wielding mods).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## 🤝 Partnerships\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWe partnered up with the following mods, to fully

All code is open source and documented. Some of its features include:\n\n### 📚 Read the Structure Gel API Documentation Here\n\nFor an open source working example of this api, check out [Dungeons Plus](https://modrinth.com/mod/dungeons-plus)\n\nYou can find detailed information on how to develop and use this API by Minecraft version.\n\n**Latest Documentation**\n- [1.16+](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.16)\n\n**Older Documentation**\n- [1.15.2](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.15)\n- [1.14.4](https://moddinglegacy.com/docs/structure-gel-api/1.14)\n\n## 🧪 Latest Features\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NWO5BqSd29E\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## 🛠️ Building Tools\n\n**The Building Tool is a new creative mode only item used to perform various large scale block alterations.**\n\n- It can be found in the Structure Items creative mode tab.\n- Right click the Building Tool in the air to open the GUI. Once open, you can select what mode you want to use, undo, redo, select your position, and more.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_gui.png\" alt=\"Building Tool GUI\">\n\n### GUI\n\nThe GUI contains various buttons to modify the Building Tool's settings, as well as some convienent tools.\n\n- Pressing, `enter`, `e`, `escape`, or clicking anywhere on the screen that isn't a button will close the GUI.\n- Hovering over any item on the GUI will display a tooltip on the right side to explain what it does and how to use it.\n- Using the radial menu, you can select which mode you want to use.\n- Some modes support positions. If they do, a button will appear on the top left to select a position based on your current location. This is mainly useful when right clicking a block isn't possible or is highly inconvenient.\n- The Undo and Redo buttons on the left exist to do exactly what they say. They attempt to undo or redo the last action you performed with the Building Tool. Up to 32 actions are saved and can be undone.\n- Some modes have additional settings, these settings will appear below the undo and redo buttons.\n- The button in the middle is used to select what block you want to use. When you click it, a text box will open for you to type a block state. This can be done in game as well, but some blocks like water are more than difficult to click on.\n\n### Controls\n\n- Middle Click: Selects the current block state you're looking at (also can be done in the GUI).\n- Left Click: This is the general key for \"do the thing\" depending on what mode you're in.\n- Right Click Air: Opens the GUI.\n- Right Click Block: Some modes use this to set positions, but ones that don't also allow this to \"do the thing\" as well.\n- Shift + Right Click: Clears the currently selected positions.\n\n### Modes\n\nBuilding Tool Modes are different operations that the Building Tool can perform.\n\n- Extend: Detects a pattern based on the side of the block you click, and attempts to place blocks in front of that to continue that pattern. If you're familiar with the old Builder's Wands mod, it's essentially the same idea.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_extend.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Extend\">\n\n- Flood: Fills all air blocks within the y level slice that you click, until it hits a border, then continues to fill going downward. This is useful for filling a lake with water for example.\n- Fill: Very similar to the vanilla fill command. Select two corners and then left click to fill the area between with the currently selected block. Has options for replacing specific blocks and only placing a frame or hollow box.\n- Line: Places a line of blocks between the selected positions using the currently selected block.\n- Clone: Copies the selected region and pastes it where you click. Allows for rotating, mirroring, and cutting instead of copying.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_clone.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Clone\">\n\n- Move: Moves the selected region in the direction that you punch.\n- Clear: Removes all blocks within the selected positions.\n- Shape: Places a shape where you click. The shape and what blocks will be replaced can be changed though the mode's properties in the GUI.\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/modding-legacy/structure-gel-api/-/raw/1.18.x/changelogs/building_tool_shape.png\" alt=\"Building Tool Shape\">\n\n### Mode Properties\n\nSome modes support additional settings to modify their behavior. Some examples include:\n\n- Integrity: Determines how many blocks will actually place.\n- Replace: Determines what the mode will replace when placing blocks. All replaces everything, Air replaces only air, and Clicked replaces the block you clicked on.\n- Rotation and Mirror: Rotates or mirrors the cloned region. Allows for selecting a random value as well.\n\n## 🍡 Structure Gel Block\n\nThis block is a creative tool to fill the insides of structures easily. The gel is replaced with air when your structure generates while all air is ignored when being placed. This ensures that your structures won't have natural terrain where it shouldn't be. The gel block behaves similarly to structure voids in that you can walk through it, while actually being visible.\n\nWhen placing gel while sneaking, you can trigger the spreading mechanic. Each gel spreads differently, and you can read how they work by hovering over the item.\n\n## 🍮 Meet the Gels!\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Red Gel</summary>\n\n### Red Gel\n\nRed gel uses the default spreading mechanic, spreading along the cardinal directions, only replacing air.\n\n![Red Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/503c7a3dae8e758a1db3fa55e64d75f856576784.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Blue Gel\n\nBlue gel functions similarly to red, except it won't spread into locations where the sky can be seen.\n\n![Blue Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/e21b268d8e6aab180443d805f5041f1993fedbd0.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Blue Gel</summary>\n\n### Green Gel\n\nGreen gel spreads the same as red gel, with the addition of also spreading diagonally. This allows it to get through corners created by vines or other complex builds. Be careful not to let it leak outside of your build.\n\n![Green Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/361a39fc615627ccdde9dbccd4f5b1ff491bb7cc.gif)\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cyan Gel</summary>\n\n### Cyan Gel\n\nCyan gel acts as a combination of green and blue gel, by both spreading diagonally and avoiding the sky.\n\n![Cyan Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0d18b88d9a6441352e39341ebe7a69cb7e221bf3.gif)\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Orange Gel</summary>\n\n### Orange Gel\n\nOrange gel behaves the same as red gel, but the distance it spreads is determined by how many you're holding when you place it, making it handy for builds in open areas.\n\n![Orange Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/0eb11f35e96d7f27f8ccf58fa1bfecb2bd5733f8.gif)<br>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Yellow Gel</summary>\n\n### Yellow Gel\n\nYellow gel will only spread along the plane that you're facing when you place it, making it great for sealing off walls, windows, or other holes that the gel would otherwise go through.\n\n![Yellow Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/f8e014711ee125fadf49da2f3154ee95541ff1e8.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Removing Gels</summary>\n\n## Removing Gels\n\nGel can be removed by using gunpowder on it. Doing this will trigger a chain reaction, removing all connected gels of the same type.\n\n![Removing Gel](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/06352441f7bd8e0fc14d3bd8af3f5c5449aefe30.gif)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Examples</summary>\n\n## Examples\n\nHere's an example of how it could be used in a build. If this structure were loaded into the game, the gel inside would be replaced with air, while the air outside would not be placed.\n\n![house_example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/images/d825a427e103a45857cc527bd3027f3736bc2eb1.gif)<br>\n\nThe code for this block is designed in a way such that you can easily extend it and hook into its behavior with methods in blocks.IStructureGel, should you need behavior not already implemented.\n\nThis is a core mod that modifies a few internal classes. If you get a crash with this mod that only occurs when mixed with another mod, this may be the cause. Please test before reporting.\n</details>\n\n\n\n\n","published":"2023-05-21T23:11:08.916649Z","updated":"2023-11-25T22:09:36.837547Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":30918,"followers":18,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["rrIuQG5f","YtlOh5ib","n7xrHFAI","hoSPdpVk","sC5VyD3U","Yj94wn7H","bsBVjIWk","bgOjiT8y","pCNl93Ka","DjvKx9sL","p2hBgWM7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/80dbc0d2d3acadcfcfc1bfa79488f0d353bac1ea.png"},"version":{"id":"bsBVjIWk","project_id":"T8TGycIQ","author_id":"QlRPeSYG","featured":false,"name":"Structure Gel API v2.7.3","version_number":"2.7.3","changelog":"# Fixes\n- Fixed an issue that could cause a world lockup when creating an entity through a data handler.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-23T18:57:08.498745Z","downloads":1467,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"3d5a2dcef1f41ad5ae814b9a8bfa692c98814eed0adcb5e030c42437edc3b101052401f511c0f2418877abadebe9640c359735955787db511b1ac84587e45407","sha1":"bb51b7f6c13ece3dd15f417b2442a9b435841b88"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T8TGycIQ/versions/bsBVjIWk/structure_gel-1.19.2-2.7.3.jar","filename":"structure_gel-1.19.2-2.7.3.jar","primary":true,"size":706623,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"JuGQbIAJ","user":{"id":"87hYFRoM","username":"ModdingLegacy","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112349370?v=4","bio":"Creators of the Minecraft mod Blue Skies!

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates:

It seeks to add new kinds of butterflies to your world that can help you in many situations!\n\n \n\n <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/Lil_Wings/BH_NU_BANNER1.png\" alt = \"Overview\"></p>\n\nThis mod adds 12 new butterflies, 50+ new items, and a handful of blocks that lighten up your world with new butterfly related content to play with.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/Lil_Wings/BH_NU_BANNER2.png\" alt = \"Features\"></p>\n\n\n\n\nEach butterfly has a unique function when captured and let into a glass jar. Glass jars can be placed into the world by simply shift right clicking a glass bottle onto the ground. You can let a butterfly go inside a jar by right clicking them with a net and then right clicking a glass jar with the filled net. They will help you by performing special actions inside jars, which can range from anything to transformation of blocks, picking up items, or healing surrounding players. More information on each book can be found in \"The Great Butter Book\" once you install Patchouli\n\n \n\nThis wonderful video by SirColor shows all the features in Lil' Wings\n<iframe width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_COZOAjfOBw\" title=\"Lil' Wings (Minecraft Mod Showcase) | Forge/Fabric 1.18.2/1.19.2\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

You can find it at <code>.minecraft/config/blockrunner.json</code> and add or remove your own custom speed values for blocks and block tags. To reload the config in-game run <code>/reload</code> (the same command that also reloads data packs).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure other settings in this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure other settings in this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

This is useful for modpacks that want to advertise themselves, or for people who simply want a nicer way to show that they are playing Minecraft. \n\nThis mod works out of the box, but you can customize it to suit your needs. Please refer to the WIKI above for more info\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_config.jpg)\n\nHate editing config files by hand? Why not try out the simple to use, [Config Editor App](https://srpcupdater.hypherionmc.me/) designed for Simple RPC. This app allows you to edit the config file step by step and even includes a Preview to show you what your Rich Presence will look like.\n\nThis app is available on Windows, Linux and Mac. You can download it from [HERE](https://srpcupdater.hypherionmc.me/)\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_help.jpg)\n\nYou can always refer to the [WIKI](https://srpc.fdd-docs.com) for help, but while I try to keep everything as simple as possible and keep the docs as useful as possible, sometimes things go wrong or it just doesn't make any sense. \n\nYou are more than welcome to open an Issue on Github if it's a bug or suggestion, or for quicker support, you can join our discord and ask your question in the appropriate channel\n\n![](https://cdn.firstdark.dev/artpacks/srpc/srpc_perms.jpg)\n\nIf it wasn't clear from the description, you are allowed to use this mod in your modpack. You are not allowed to Sell or rehost this mod elsewhere.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

In the game directory, go into&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/Multiplayer_[server_address]/DIM-1/[map_folder]</em>. If such doesn't exist already, create a folder called \"<strong>caves</strong>\", without the quotation marks, and go into it. Inside the caves folder, create a folder called \"<strong>-2147483648</strong>\", without the quotation marks, if such doesn't exist already. Go back into the folder that contains the \"<strong>caves</strong>\" folder and move all \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files to the&nbsp;<strong><em>caves/-2147483648</em></strong>&nbsp;folder. Feel free to delete the cache folders or also move them with the \"<strong>.zip</strong>\" files.</p>\n\n### How do I set up cave mode to behave like it used to pre 1.30 before cave mode was introduced?\n\n<p>You can fully achieve this only when using the normal version of the minimap or no minimap at all. The fair-play version of the minimap now disables world map cave mode in the Nether and you can't toggle that, so it won't be exactly like it used to be.</p>\n<p>If you have Nether map data from before 1.30, please start by moving it in the correct folder as explained under \"<em>How do I restore pre 1.30 update Nether maps in multiplayer to be displayed in the \"full\" cave mode type?</em>\" on this page.<br />After you're done with that, join a world/server and open the world map settings. Locate \"Default Cave Mode Type\" and set it to OFF and then set \"Legible Cave Maps\" to ON. Next, open the world map screen and click the cave icon in the bottom left of the screen. In the menu that opens, set the \"Cave Mode Top Y\" to absolutely any number. If you are in the overworld, set the \"Cave Mode Type\" to OFF. When you are in the Nether later, set&nbsp;\"Cave Mode Type\" to Full. The cave mode type is stored per dimension, so you can set it to Full for any nether-like dimension and keep it on OFF for anything else. You can also switch between displaying below and above bedrock roof by toggling it.</p>\n\n### Why does right-click teleportation not work for me?\n\nThe mod sends a chat command to teleport you to specific coordinates, which is _/tp @s x y z_ by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla /tp command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the world map settings with \"Map Teleport Command\". Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. There is also an option called \"Player Teleport Command\" which is used when you right click tracked players (e.g. your party from Open Parties and Claims). Teleportation to waypoints uses its own setting in the minimap mod. You can read about it on the minimap description page under FAQ.\n\n### How do I discover the map without manually walking?\n\n<p>In singleplayer, the map is loaded directly from the world save. This means that you can pregenerate the world using whatever tools you prefer, relog and use the \"Reload Regions\" option in the world map settings to fix any conflicts in the map cache. In multiplayer, there is no official way to do that. Copying cache from a singleplayer map will not work.</p>\n\n### Why are multiple worlds on the same server address/IP using and writing to the same map?\n\n<p>This mod lets you have multiple maps on the same server address. You can freely switch between maps and create new ones at any time. Map overwriting can be prevented by choosing the right \"Map Selection\" mode for the type of server that you are playing on. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you don't have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why does the world map ask for confirmation?\n\n<p>A single server address can have multiple overworlds, nethers etc. It can be due to multiple sub-servers or just multiple world saves, for example a \"Lobby\" world and a \"Game\" world. Different worlds don't have any unique identifiers on the client side, which makes it impossible to reliably differentiate between them. Because of this, the world map mod lets you have multiple world maps for each dimension on the same server address. In older mod versions, by default, map selection is <em>Manual</em>, which means that you are asked to confirm which map to use every time you switch dimensions/worlds/sub-servers. You can also choose one of the 2 automatic modes. Map selection is done in a special menu by clicking the bottom left icon on the world map screen (if the menu isn't open by default). In the menu you can switch between <em>Manual</em>, <em>World Spawn</em> and <em>Single</em> modes and select/create maps by using the top-center dropdown menu. If you hover over the <em>Map Selection</em> option, you can read everything you need to know about each map selection mode, including <em>Server</em> mode. <em>World Spawn </em>mode is the equivalent of what was used by the world map pre 1.6. So you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">don't</span> have to downgrade the mod to still use it. <em>Server&nbsp;</em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server automatically controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side. If changing the map selection mode switches your map to an empty one, you can always rebind the map that you want to be used by selecting it from the dropdown menu and confirming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Why can't I see my minimap waypoints on a server after the installation of the world map?\n\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic. This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting <em>Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n\n### Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. Old world map versions use a world spawn-based system to separate a server into multiple maps. This system often breaks because of servers adding custom functionality to the vanilla compass item by sending fake world spawn coordinates to your game client.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Make sure you update the mod to the latest version.</strong>&nbsp;There are now multiple map selection modes you can choose between,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;being the default one. You can now view any world map you have on the current server address. Click the bottom left icon on the world map to open the map selection menu, if it's not open by default. <strong>The top center dropdown menu allows you to select existing or create new world maps.</strong> You can hover over the map selection mode setting (bottom left) to read about how each mode works. <em>Server </em>mode is the best option for most cases because the server controls your map selection based on server-side level IDs. It requires the mod to be installed on the server side.&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Manual</em>&nbsp;mode is the safest alternative and should work on every other server. There are also 2 additional automatic map selection modes when <em>Server</em> mode isn't an option. Read more about them in the tooltip of the setting.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">Old map is not in the map menu?&nbsp;</em></strong></u>This can mean 2 things: the server address has changed or the dimension IDs have changed.</p>\n<p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<u><strong class=\"bbc\">dimension ID change</strong></u>. Each dimension on the server has a separate directory in the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you begin doing anything with it.</strong>&nbsp;In older mod versions, the dimension directory name contains the server address and the dimension key, for example&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1_DIM1</em>. In newer versions the dimension directory is a sub-directory, so something like&nbsp;<em>XaeroWorldMap/</em><em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/DIM1.</em> For compatibility reasons, default&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">overworld, nether and the end</em>&nbsp;dimensions are named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">null, DIM-1 and DIM1</em>. Other dimensions should have their name be based on the original dimension ID, for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Multiplayer_127.0.0.1/minecraft$overworld_creative</em>. In 1.16+, you can see your current dimension ID on the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">F3 screen ingame</em>&nbsp;to figure out which directory is meant for which dimension (for example \"minecraft:overworld\").&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Please exit to the game title screen or close the game before editing files/directories.</em><br />Each dimension directory contains sub-directories, one for each map that you have in the dimension (for example&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw$default</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw-4,0,-4</em>) as well as a file named&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">dimension_config.txt&nbsp;</em>that contains the actual display names of the maps. You can use the file to help you find a specific map directory that you want. Moving/copying a map directory between dimension directories should move/copy it between dimensions. You can give it a name later ingame.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">The most common case would be&nbsp;</em></strong>something like moving a map from <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/null</em></strong>&nbsp;to <strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">/minecraft$overworld_survival</em></strong>. It is needed when a 1.16+ server starts using a unique dimension ID for each sub-world.</p>\n<p><u><strong class=\"bbc\">For server address changes</strong></u>, you would first have to remove all directories inside&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">game directory -&gt; XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;that contain the new server address. There is usually only 1 such directory if you are using the latest mod version.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Please backup the whole&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory before you do that. Also, exit the game at least to the title screen.&nbsp;</strong>Then you would have to rename each old server address directory (in XaeroWorldMap) to the new address, replacing ONLY the address part.</p>\n<p>Message me or leave a comment if you have questions!</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Here's the old explanation if you can't update the mod to 1.6.1 or newer:</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted (this has never happened as far as I know). It's likely caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection. In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the map \"resetting\".<br />If the map \"reset\" because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your map (and hope the plugin doesn't do it again):</p>\n<p>Make sure Minecraft is&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\"><em class=\"bbc\">NOT RUNNING</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>1. Go to the game directory</p>\n<p>2. Go to the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">XaeroWorldMap</em>&nbsp;directory</p>\n<p>3. Find directories that represent the dimensions you have visited on the server. These directories contain the address of the server in their name. The one that ends with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>&nbsp;is the overworld,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">_dim-1</em>&nbsp;is Nether etc.</p>\n<p>4. Open the overworld directory (<em class=\"bbc\">_null</em>).</p>\n<p>5. You should see multiple directories that start with&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>.</p>\n<p>6. Find the one that is the biggest in file size. Copy the name of it somewhere so you don't lose it.</p>\n<p>7. Now find the newest&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">mw</em>&nbsp;directory (likely the emptiest or just check the creation date). Move this directory somewhere else.&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Don't delete it just yet.</strong></p>\n<p>8. Rename the directory from step 6 to the name of the backed up directory from step 7.</p>\n<p>9. Open Minecraft and test if the overworld world map is back.</p>\n<p>10. If it's not, exit Minecraft and restore the old name of the directory that you have renamed + restore the backed up folder. Reread all the steps to make sure you're doing everything right.<br />If overworld is now fixed, proceed to step 11.</p>\n<p>11. Rename and backup the directories with the same names as overworld for every other dimension that you'd like to restore.</p>\n<p><em class=\"bbc\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n</div>\n\n### Why have my waypoints not restored after restoring the map?\n\n<p>Please read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">minimap description</a>&nbsp;page.

Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)","published":"2022-08-07T23:18:53.898484Z","updated":"2023-08-02T21:24:26.571176Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":107238,"followers":363,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["kwef5VB1","jc4l8jNt","jhP9p06T","huqohPcW","yE9Uj2ud","vKnBI3zc","uRQmgrHj","N1aLfuNT","p5bkNiw0","9N99D1CJ","tKCwnbTN","umpztmTl","k7RoRFPF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/8e7aa38ab94d94bb0a2894a218b69beb49002b34.png"},"version":{"id":"umpztmTl","project_id":"R2OftAxM","author_id":"btHGOarG","featured":true,"name":"Farmer's Delight 1.2.3 - 1.19.2","version_number":"1.19.2-1.2.3","changelog":"### Additions\n- Added certain blocks to the `create:brittle` tag, to prevent them from being deleted randomly when disassembling contraptions;\n- New tags:\n  - `farmersdelight:flat_on_cutting_board`: Items which will always render flat and 2D when placed on a Cutting Board, to fix certain render cases.\n    - Includes Trident and Spyglass by default, due to unique render cases;\n    - Optionally includes items from a few mods, such as Autumnity's Turkey and Supplementaries' Quiver;\n\n### Updates\n- Updated method of modifying stack sizes for BowlFoodItems:\n  - Changes are now done on game start, rather than calculated during `maxStackSize()` calls;\n  - The `overrideAllSoupItems` config option has been removed, due to performance and usability concerns;\n- Cooking recipes will now drop sensible remainders for vanilla items which don't have them configured;\n- (1.20) Updated Basket textures to match the new Bamboo design and palette;\n\n### Fixes\n- Fix potential performance issues involving the stack size override for BowlFoodItems (see above);\n- (1.18.2) Rollback and replacement to previous fix for Cutting Board's rendering issues with perspective items:\n  - The previous fix fails (and may crash) with some resource packs on 1.18.2, due to differences in how the method operates.

See [Recipes page](https://mods.latvian.dev/books/kubejs/page/recipeeventjs) for more info.\n\nSupported recipe types:\n\n- `createCrushing`\n- `createCutting`\n- `createMilling`\n- `createBasin`\n- `createMixing` (supports **.heated()** and **.superheated()**)\n- `createCompacting` (supports **.heated()** and **.superheated()**)\n- `createPressing`\n- `createSandpaperPolishing`\n- `createSplashing` (Bulk Washing)\n- `createDeploying`\n- `createFilling`\n- `createEmptying`\n\n> Note: Bulk Smoking = vanilla smoking and Bulk Blasting = vanilla blasting recipe types.\n\n`event.recipes.createCrushing(output[], input[])`\nOutput doesn't have to be an array. It can be either items or fluids\nInput doesn't have to be an array. It can be either ingredients or `Fluid.of('minecraft:water', 1000)` or `{fluidTag: 'some:fluid_tag', amount: 1000}`\n\n### `createMechanicalCrafting`\n\n`event.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting(output, pattern[], {patternKey: input})`\n\nThis recipe type is the same as regular crafting table shaped recipe\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly(output[], input, sequence[]) \n// output[] are your output items\n// input is your input item\n// sequence[] is an array of sequences. These sequences are \"regular\" recipes that are supported.\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createCrushing([\n  '2x minecraft:cobblestone',\n  'minecraft:redstone',\n  Item.of('minecraft:redstone').withChance(0.5)\n], 'minecraft:redstone_ore')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMixing('create:chromatic_compound', [\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:polished_rose_quartz'\n]).superheated()\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createFilling('create:blaze_cake', [\n  'create:blaze_cake_base',\n  Fluid.of('minecraft:lava', 250)\n])\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createEmptying([\n  'minecraft:glass_bottle',\n  Fluid.of('create:honey', 250)\n], 'minecraft:honey_bottle')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting('minecraft:piston', [\n  'CCCCC',\n  'CPIPC',\n  'CPRPC'\n], {\n  C: '#forge:cobblestone',\n  P: '#minecraft:planks',\n  R: '#forge:dusts/redstone',\n  I: '#forge:ingots/iron'\n})\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly([ // start the recipe\n Item.of('6x create:large_cogwheel').withChance(32.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n Item.of('create:brass_ingot').withChance(2.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n 'minecraft:andesite', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'create:cogwheel', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:stick', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:iron_nugget' // have this item be a guaranteed output\n], 'create:brass_ingot', [ // 'create:brass_ingot' is the input.\n// the transitional item set by \"transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel')\" is the item that will be used during the recipe as the item that the input is using to transition to the output.\n event.recipes.createDeploying('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', ['create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', '#minecraft:planks']), // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array.

Input and output have the transitional item\n event.recipes.createCutting('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', 'create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').processingTime(50) // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array. Input and output have the transitional item\n]).transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').loops(6) // set the transitional item and the loops (amount of repetitions)\n```\n\nIf you want to use your own transitional item in sequenced_assembly recipes, you must register it in startup event:\n\n```javascript\nonEvent('item.registry', event => {\n  // Texture for this item goes in kubejs/assets/kubejs/textures/item/my_part.png\n  event.create('my_part', 'create:sequenced_assembly').displayName('My Part')\n})\n```\n\nThen you would use ...`transitionalItem('kubejs:my_part')`...\n\n> Note! Mysterious Conversion recipes are client side only, so the only way to add them currently is using reflection with this code in client scripts (outside any event):\n\n```javascript\nlet MysteriousItemConversionCategory = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.category.MysteriousItemConversionCategory')\nlet ConversionRecipe = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.ConversionRecipe')\n\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:apple', 'minecraft:carrot'))\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:golden_apple', 'minecraft:golden_carrot'))\n```\n\n[![](https://kubejs.com/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/lat)","published":"2023-08-21T20:20:41.279415Z","updated":"2023-11-20T15:07:35.257690Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":7617,"followers":15,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["library"],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["MO75e2sC","YN0T5Pmf","dvLO7wuv","T4V6Dm0l","cNEVOQ4q","bnvthbJW","uMNhEyBG","79c3Pl6W","VwLRcUBQ","Khlo8swW","b3ZbuHEY","eRR2DuIi","CDoBzOhr","qmHwp7h4","gUgBKKro","r6cVLbDS","I3cYQ3mX","pLyqKVXT","ftDL2MOo","XABryG8V","VszJSnhB","1INYEb9w","oRValdcl","mHfUZDSO","m9lk8iMr","65oHVwN8","VLiijTOY","rJ26X7G5","2Hq8tbrn","dxY7VzQv","zWLaf3WR","Yp60zntL","B4zWSIIO","8qUQlsto","zmzcrZEp","y7FC6Rsp","YE9yQwxx","353BVKVV","hYdnSDQB","13yE1QX6","Jqn5DRIj","A0KQFxde","Xe2y2pRp","FhVbUfLB","ClnUsQ85","HJ0xIlkM","PB33MOc1","hei9cDRa"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T38eAZQC/511b709655f4853df9ff9f3731fc1df6d2c4a20a.png"},"version":{"id":"Xe2y2pRp","project_id":"T38eAZQC","author_id":"7tgPcl7v","featured":false,"name":"KubeJS

Config Lib","description":"Config Lib makes dealing with config files just a bit easier.","body":"![SuperMartijn642's Config Lib](https://imgur.com/oVcLlAO.png)   \n**SuperMartijn642's Config Lib** allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only** on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

","body":"<p>The Friendly Fire mod will protect your pets and other vulnerable mobs from accidental damage. With this mod installed you will no longer need to worry about your pets jumping in front of your attacks or an accidental missclick with a weapon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why would anyone need this?<br></strong>Many players have issues with accidentally attacking their pets. This often happens during combat where the pet will jump in the way of an enemy. Some players also have issues with missclicking when trying to feed their pets food. For these reasons players often choose to leave their pets behind rather than taking them along on adventures. This mod aims to resolve this in a way that does not make pets unbalanced or overpowered.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?<br></strong>After installing this mod pets will be immune to attacks from their owners. Pets will also be immune to damage from pets that have the same owner as them. Additionally baby animals will also be immune to attacks from all sources. If you need to kill a protected mob for some reason simply sneak/crouch while performing the attack. The mod also provides configuration options which can be used to change or disable the types of mobs that are protected.</p>\n<p><strong>Does this work with modded pets?<br></strong>Yes modded pets should work fine. If a modded pet is not protected it is because the mod developer has not defined the entity as an ownable pet in the game code.</p>\n\n<h2>Tags</h2>\n<p>This mod provides several datapack entity tags to help improve the configuration of the mod. Datapacks are a very flexible way to configure the game and allow players, servers, other mods, and modpacks to configure certain properties.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>friendlyfire:bypass_pet - This is an item tag that allows items to bypass pet protections.</li>\n<li>friendlyfire:bypass_all - This is an item tag that allows items to bypass all protections offered by the mod.</li>\n<li>friendlyfire:general_protection - This is an entity tag that allows other mobs to be granted protection from combat damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>This <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/assets/openloader/FriendlyFire-Villagers-1.0.0.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">example datapack</a> will add villagers and wandering villagers to the protection list. When working with datapacks it is highly recommended to use a mod like <a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/open-loader\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Loader</a> that simplifies the process of installing datapacks.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (Only for Fabric)\n\n## About \n\n\"Load My Resources\" is a client-side mod to automatically load resources like images and sounds on game start.<br>\nIt's like using a resource pack, but it is enabled by default and can't be disabled by the user.<br>\nOn top of that, it's hidden from the resource pack menu, so you don't need to worry about a useless pack entry!\n\n### How to Load Resources\n\nLoading resources is not very difficult, but if you absolutely don't know how resource packs work, please watch a YouTube tutorial first or this will be a bit hard for you.\n\n1. To generate all important directories and files, start the game one time with the mod installed and close it again.\n2. Open the newly generated folder named 'resources' in your '.minecraft' directory. This is the directory the mod will load your resources from.\n3. Copy all resources you want to load to the 'resources' folder. If you want to load resources from a resource pack, copy everything from inside the pack's 'assets' folder to this directory.\n4. Start the game and you will now be able to use the loaded resources in mods and resources from a resource pack will be visible in game.\n\n**Nice To Know:**\nThe `resources` folder is like the `assets` folder in a resource pack. So namespaces work exactly the same as for a normal resource pack.\nFor example: If you put a texture in `resources/mytextures`, the namespace of textures inside the `mytextures` folder will be \"mytextures\".\n\n## Bug Reports and Requests\n\nYou can report bugs and request features either on [GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Load-My-Resources/issues) or via [Discord](https://discord.gg/UzmeWkD)!\n\n## Modpacks\n\n\"Load My Resources\" can be freely used in modpacks.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nTo my patrons:<br>\n- Kreezxil<br>\n- q!!!<br>\n- Jolihan<br>\n\n## Copyright\n\n\"Load My Resources\" Copyright © 2021 Keksuccino.<br>\n\"Load My Resources\" is licensed under KML (Keksuccino Mod License).<br>\nSee \"Custom License\" in the \"About Project\" section for more informations about the license.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a href=\"https://bisecthosting.com/keksuccino\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/100003401-505d5300-2dc6-11eb-9444-3dd117a8aef9.png\" width=\"241\" height=\"244\" /></a><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><br /></span></p>","published":"2022-11-23T22:33:01.363745Z","updated":"2023-09-24T04:55:52.476727Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":154786,"followers":73,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["wYEBYtRc","LS7zFG0F","ZvOOKnBo","7wNkRxrR","BlnsvnLh","ncfcapSO","XS4A9Aoo","ErYeBTin","7WP876Jm","gXzSBMIG","EQeLLVsf","q8si2roM","VA60FWUa","lsBN5Uh2","8MDPsQ9J","vO7R2WNi","L7MIAeTT","r45QO9Cd"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TqCKvqjC/52f56718a4367dbf009524348c325bd86a81aed4.png"},"version":{"id":"q8si2roM","project_id":"TqCKvqjC","author_id":"k0LcYHWE","featured":false,"name":"[Forge] v1.0.4 MC 1.19-1.19.2","version_number":"1.0.4-1.19-1.19.2-forge","changelog":"\n<br>CHANGELOG | LOAD MY RESOURCES v1.0.4\n \n<br>- License changed to GPLv3\n\n<br>","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-26T21:57:58.991545Z","downloads":4408,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"21355321ee4e079a3b04430c54ff8490a12bf9e06b0409b03a43b3178139cce8c48207f50448402982aa760172123e5c5dd194753eb2cc214bf1827a2a03fe0f","sha1":"c9259e6e2ed793cacb4a4bcb15d69051a7293dd5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TqCKvqjC/versions/q8si2roM/loadmyresources_forge_1.0.4_MC_1.19-1.19.2.jar","filename":"loadmyresources_forge_1.0.4_MC_1.19-1.19.2.jar","primary":true,"size":31790,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"9e1c8228554e358a50d07afc370fa6c602b4a6bd","sha512":"023fd1d0e7a8898e863d02e527cd7e5b1f4d0398c318415c77cf39440e0cc20acde9e6528cb876e3ec28f0da836573fef8ce6a195b799dbe844266263e8d2ca6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/TqCKvqjC/versions/q8si2roM/dev_loadmyresources_forge_1.0.4_MC_1.19-1.19.2.jar","filename":"dev_loadmyresources_forge_1.0.4_MC_1.19-1.19.2.jar","primary":false,"size":45183,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"MQVnLgFq","user":{"id":"k0LcYHWE","username":"keksuccino","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35544624?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-03-30T18:22:57.742857Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"loadmyresources_forge_1.0.4_MC_1.19-1.19.2.jar"},"mods\\moonlight-1.19.2-2.3.5-forge.jar":{"sha512":"b1c368c382e0001dfe714b9b20589f0b6a6c29caad320ee8c1af4a8b66d3cd74125fdaa84f645465ca64927cd94de7460373b4ef84e40ca1077ca4327d9bdfd3","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"twkfQtEc","slug":"moonlight","project_type":"mod","team":"Se0LRYS8","title":"Moonlight Lib","description":"dynamic data pack and registration, villager activities, custom map marker and a lot more","body":"Features of this library are:\n\n- Dynamic resource pack utilities\nA set of utilities that allow creating dynamic runtime resource packs and datapacks. Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

various treasure items that can be found through exploration","body":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ochotonida/artifacts/1.18/src/main/resources/logo.png)\n\nSome older versions of this mod can be found on curseforge: [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts) /  [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/artifacts-fabric)\n\nArtifacts is a mod which aims to make exploration more rewarding by adding various powerful items that cannot be crafted.\n\nThe items added by this mod can be found in chests in vanilla structures. All artifacts only have a few chests in which they can be found, so go out and explore! Additionally, a new underground campsite structure has been added. Mimics occasionally spawn in these campsites instead of a chests, which are dangerous enemies that attack players that get too close. Mimics always drop a random artifact when killed.\n\nEvery item added by this mod has a unique model when equipped. The full set of items, their descriptions, and the places where they can appear can be found in the images tab.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37985539/118691060-fdaaa400-b808-11eb-97c8-2f45ef277c52.png)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\n#### _Some items are too powerful, is there some way I can change that?_\n\nArtifacts adds various game rules that allow you to change or completely disable the effects of all items added by the mod.\nIn versions for Forge 1.19.2 and below, most of these config options are located in the server config. Unlike the client and common config files, server config files are located in your world save's _serverconfigs_ folder. Preventing specific items from spawning in chests is currently not possible without creating a data pack, but it is possible to change how rare artifacts are in general using the artifactRarity (for items in chests) and campsite count/mimicChance (for mimics) config options.\n\n#### _How do I change the amount of slots for my artifacts?_\n\nIf you're using the Forge version, It is possible to change the number of slots of each type using the Curios server config. The '/curios' command can also be used to add/remove slots for one specific player. If you want to change the slot an artifact can be placed in, you will need to create a data pack and change the item tags that determine the artifact's slot types.\nMore information on how to do all of these things can be found on the [Curios wiki](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users).\n\nIf you're using the Fabric version, modifying the number of slots players have requires creating a data pack. Information about the data formats used can be found on the [Trinkets wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Trinkets-Data-Formats).\n\n#### _Which mod are you using to put artifacts on armor stands?_\n\n[Curious Armor Stands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curious-armor-stands \"\").\n\n#### _Can I still find artifacts if I add this mod to a world that has already been generated?_\n\nCampsites and mimics will only spawn in chunks that were generated after you downloaded the mod. You will still be able to find artifacts in unopened chests in existing chunks.\n\n#### [Forge] _Whey I try to open the Curios menu to equip my artifacts, nothing happens._\n\nSome server plugins can cause this (https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/issues/131). If you're using plugins, verify that this issue also happens in a Forge-only environment before asking for help.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/298798089068609537/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/87pXJadaRr)","published":"2022-06-14T16:56:58.872057Z","updated":"2023-11-11T16:15:44.780299Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":66281,"followers":290,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["vtfSrjwt","enKgSs94","mPPkxtPE","tr5a9mT8","e4CTWqPl","fSw9kqQh","V8ExzIs5","NyF72ZGD","o0rov6DO","qXHbzxWN","3uzmjVVv","qrgK6WbC","qYmael6x","aR9WUkuw","jNhlay28","l9VPEvbV","V30gGFiR","mqynvjMF","M29wAfi3","lEZPMdyg","NZW4ytS1","Mx3Od65u","v3E2bsYR","1DMHqctP","bJzHzT51","6DXOR2pO","b349kUSi","Czb4tu7o","bfIQoQHe","r3FHm0nE","bbR3MLn5"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/P0Mu4wcQ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"b349kUSi","project_id":"P0Mu4wcQ","author_id":"Q50e8wKr","featured":false,"name":"Artifacts Forge 5.0.4","version_number":"5.0.4+forge","changelog":"- Fixed a duplication glitch with Alex's Mobs' Ghostly Pickaxe","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-10T16:53:49.579484Z","downloads":2654,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"bc427191b2f1982b2d133b7933716b3748764e198114fddeded63cdec2f2fe9da72727b0d209e51f15f24ef66f0d748e3ddbc65678e6c89f53c4194cda934852","sha1":"a6f4060cfc6e0c7805d69f7c9862419e28004709"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/P0Mu4wcQ/versions/b349kUSi/artifacts-1.19.2-5.0.4.jar","filename":"artifacts-1.19.2-5.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":601729,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"vvuO3ImH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"6u3haPJ2","user":{"id":"Q50e8wKr","username":"ochotonida","name":"Wouter Pauwels","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37985539?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-14T17:07:57.731048Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"6u3haPJ2","user":{"id":"XGleyE7i","username":"florens","name":"Florens Pauwels","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/XGleyE7i/icon.png","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-27T16:43:27.596174Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"artifacts-1.19.2-5.0.4.jar"},"mods\\supplementaries-1.19.2-2.3.20.jar":{"sha512":"172da7ab829ae9ee3ecd6c85df35fa43d29b9679b27d30bd811e2b43aa05d81a223c6dcfeca104138397688c1ad757ac6a551c65b8ae0eb5a2697545bbf9826f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"fFEIiSDQ","slug":"supplementaries","project_type":"mod","team":"GgWB22vK","title":"Supplementaries","description":"Vanilla+ additions: Jars, signposts, faucets, weather vanes spring launchers, sconces, planters, lights, decoration and automation","body":"<span ><a href=\"https://www.akliz.net/supplementaries\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZpeKQZQ.png\" alt=\"Supplementaries Mod\" width=\"1519\" height=\"855\"></a></span>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:14px;font-family:helvetica, arial, sans-serif\">&nbsp;</span>\n<center>\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/qdKRTDf8Cv\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/790151253144895508?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Discord&\" alt=\"Supplementaries Discord\"></a> <a href=\"https://patreon.com/mehvahdjukaar\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=mehvahdjukaar&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/Supplementariez\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Supplementariez?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Twitter&message=Twitter&\" alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOaLLgwzOdbH6rCI7izCptw\" rel=\"nofollow\"> <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCOaLLgwzOdbH6rCI7izCptw?label=&color=2d2d2d&labelColor=dddddd&style=for-the-badge&logo=Youtube&message=Twitter&logoColor=ff0000\" alt=\"Supplementaries Twitter\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h2>📖About 📖</h2>\n</center>\n\nSupplementaries is a highly configurable Forge mod focused on adding valuable content which fills the gaps vanilla has.

A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

[KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs).<br>\n\n\n## **✏️ Your first loot modification**\nLoot modifications are handled server side. So all your scripts will go into your `your_minecraft_instance/kubejs/server_scripts` directory. Just create a `.js` file and let's get started.\n\nHere's simple example which adds a gunpowder for creepers:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addEntityLootModifier(\"minecraft:creeper\")\n        .randomChance(0.3) // 30% chance\n        .thenAdd(\"minecraft:gunpowder\");\n});\n```\n\nInstead of using a loot table for reference, you can also apply the modification to all entities:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addLootTypeModifier(LootType.ENTITY) // you also can use multiple types\n        .logName(\"It's raining loot\") // you can set a custom name for logging\n        .weatherCheck({\n            raining: true,\n        })\n        .thenModify(Ingredient.getAll(), (itemStack) => {\n            // you have to return an item!\n            return itemStack.withCount(itemStack.getCount() * 2);\n        });\n});\n```\n\nNext, let's check if the player holds a specific item:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addBlockLootModifier(\"#forge:ores\") // keep in mind this is a block tag not an item tag\n        .matchEquip(EquipmentSlot.MAINHAND, Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n        .thenAdd(\"minecraft:gravel\");\n\n    // for MainHand and OffHand you can also use:\n    // matchMainHand(Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n    // matchOffHand(Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n});\n```\n\n## **⚙️ More Information**\nFor more information about the usage and the functionality of the mod, please\nvisit our [wiki](https://github.com/AlmostReliable/lootjs/wiki) or explore the [examples](https://github.com/AlmostReliable/lootjs/tree/1.18/examples/server_scripts).\n\n ","published":"2022-06-27T18:05:23.475024Z","updated":"2023-09-27T18:27:25.974843Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":8659,"followers":8,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["mFLuNFHm","hdvavw2q","9P5V9gIO","wXTFesGW","VPYMwdDZ","tCW7mX1B","NMgJ2BlW","4JTbTxna","M7zQPypE","DtITrdt2","TwuesVHU","dc4FblBM","mQY75nBx","43ysRHNC","xIhBIDCV","cqtZlIPm","QJcpcmCW","rFw5aG3j","ImRUsMr4","T6sCwY4E","f2PysaRK","6aIOGY3T","dIIoIaGP","WKbyXlEH","4iK3pEyB","pDtOjljn","339GMBvC","ZarmSG5O","TBtmuPUD","n50jyCjI","7sHZinNx","ir4lOEDc","jvKVmC1y","1BTiNfZJ","s11oQXBD","1Utbex3o","fMlyQgDv","o4CsupJu","CTvG0oqw","FhBctaP5","azVN541R","jvfh1QhA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fJFETWDN/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"1BTiNfZJ","project_id":"fJFETWDN","author_id":"W7UYQWZT","featured":true,"name":"LootJS-Forge-1.19.2-2.9.1","version_number":"1.19.2-2.9.1+forge","changelog":"### Changed\n- Fix bug where loot does not drop if CraftTweaker is installed together with LootJS on fabric\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-17T12:32:59.321940Z","downloads":738,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"613e702f057cffd60bb2566802d98818c7a9f3c5db901f3db326ffb5d6ff1afbd19aa66d77a285e73e15be2fd1b3d44c442270c195955ea9f5c8071f8b8a3000","sha1":"73d4569729843e1838d15aa0d63f933318d76790"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fJFETWDN/versions/1BTiNfZJ/lootjs-forge-1.19.2-2.9.1.jar","filename":"lootjs-forge-1.19.2-2.9.1.jar","primary":true,"size":237091,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"umyGl7zF","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"PMRuK7v3","user":{"id":"W7UYQWZT","username":"Lytho","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29131229?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-18T18:30:43.104912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"PMRuK7v3","user":{"id":"qtbuSRQ6","username":"Relentless","name":"Relentless","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16513358?v=4","bio":"Hobby developer mostly developing bots or mods.","created":"2022-02-28T01:07:44.015749Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lootjs-forge-1.19.2-2.9.1.jar"},"mods\\kubejs-forge-1902.6.2-build.42.jar":{"sha512":"3335034d61e3a52a6ec621212b4fa86e8974fe67f384e6d4cf73a4396ac6f3acc9013b66b7edf6b31758071af915d8aee77ebc179a85beba75d4af67ad6cec93","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"umyGl7zF","slug":"kubejs","project_type":"mod","team":"YlpCyjKr","title":"KubeJS","description":"Edit recipes, add new custom items, script world events, all in JavaScript!","body":"# KubeJS\n\n---\n\n## What does this mod do?\nThis mod lets you create scripts in JavaScript language to manage your server, add new blocks and items, change recipes and tags, add custom handlers for quest mods, change worldgen and more!\n\n## How to use it?\nRun the game with mod installed once. It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can

2023-01-27\n### Added\n- Added utility methods to creative tab builder to automatically add all enchantments and potions from a mod\n### Changed\n- Applied transitive access widener to `AbstractSkeleton::getStepSound` to make the class extensible \n\n## [v4.3.32-1.19.2] - 2023-01-20\n### Changed\n- Improved handling of configs with default values (those are loaded when a config is accessed before it has been loaded)\n- Built-in protection for `com.electronwill.nightconfig.core.io.ParsingException: Not enough data available`\n- Puzzles Lib now explicitly requires the Minecraft version it's been compiled on (which is 1.19.2 currently)\n\n## [v4.3.31-1.19.2] - 2023-01-18\n### Changed\n- Server mod configs are now stored in the global `.minecraft/config` directory instead of locally per world\n- This effectively disables local per-world server configs, but helps a lot with user confusion and frustration\n\n## [v4.3.30-1.19.2] - 2023-01-17\n### Fixed\n- Fixed backwards compatibility for a few changed method signatures\n\n## [v4.3.29-1.19.2] - 2023-01-17\n### Fixed\n- Fix access level of methods in `BlockRenderTypesContext`\n\n## [v4.3.28-1.19.2] -

2023-01-13\n### Added\n- Added a utility method for getting a mod's display name in common\n\n## [v4.3.26-1.19.2] - 2023-01-09\n### Changed\n- Use mod loader provided methods for registering brewing recipes instead of custom implementation\n\n## [v4.3.25-1.19.2] - 2023-01-06\n### Added\n- Added `ModConstructor::onRegisterBiomeModifications` similar to Forge's old `BiomeLoadingEvent` from before Minecraft 1.19 for applying biome modifications in code in the common project rather than via data packs (like Forge does now)\n- This includes a port of a big portion of Fabric API's biome api to the common workspace, so that Forge's current biome modification system can be implemented on top of it\n### Changed\n- Expanded `ReflectionHelperV2` to allow for passing target classes in as a raw type name to handle classes that may not be accessible or not present at runtime\n- Networking classes related to the V2 implementation are no longer marked deprecated as they are still wildly used and the new system does not provide an advantage in most use cases\n\n## [v4.3.24-1.19.2] - 2023-01-03\n### Added\n- Added `ItemModelOverrides` for registering custom item models for certain `ItemTransforms.TransformType`s (like trident and spyglass)\n### Fixed\n- Fixed custom `BlockEntityWithoutLevelRenderer`s not reloading when the resource listener does on Forge\n\n## [v4.3.23-1.19.2] -

It is also <strong>the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. </strong>Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a <strong>circle-shaped minimap</strong> and a separate setting for <strong>locking the minimap's rotation</strong> (using a direction arrow instead). The minimap can display the surrounding entities, including <strong>players, mobs and items</strong>, as <strong>dots with a custom color</strong> or as <strong>icons (usually heads)</strong>. In addition to the default <strong>compass directions</strong>, you can place your own&nbsp;<strong>waypoints </strong>that are visible both on the minimap and in the game world.&nbsp;Waypoints help you find previously visited locations or reach specific coordinates, with <strong>optional teleportation</strong>. The minimap can display the surrounding blocks above ground and below ground (<strong>cave mode</strong>). These are just some of the features of the mod while there are many more. Please read the \"Minimap features\" section below for a more complete list. For the purposes of following multiplayer server rules, there are 2 mod editions, full and fair-play, the latter being designed for fair PVP.&nbsp;<strong>This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification.</strong></p>\n\n### Follow me on Mastodon (Twitter alternative)?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mas.to/@xaero96\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">mas.to/@xaero96</a>\n\n### Support me on Patreon?</strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https://bit.ly/PatreonXaero96\">patreon.com/xaero96</a></span>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n### Features\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Look of vanilla Minecraft</strong>.</li>\n<li>Multiple minimap size options including automatic.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple zoom options.</li>\n<li>Two minimap shape options: <strong>square or circle</strong>.</li>\n<li>Runs&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">smoother than a lot of minimap mods</strong>.</li>\n<li>Can be placed anywhere on the screen using the \"Change Position\" setting/screen. You can even shift it by 1 pixel if you so wish. Can be useful when playing with other UI mods.</li>\n<li>2 block color modes:&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Vanilla</strong>, which uses the colors of vanilla Minecraft maps and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">Accurate</strong>, which uses the colors of block textures and biomes. You can also enable biome colors for the Vanilla mode using a separate setting.</li>\n<li>A custom key binding (Z by default) to temporarily enlarge the minimap to take a better look around.&nbsp;<strong>All key bindings are in the vanilla controls menu.&nbsp;</strong>There are also settings for controlling the behavior of the minimap when it is enlarged, for example to center the minimap on the screen or to fully zoom out the minimap.</li>\n<li>Map shading customization with the \"Terrain Depth\" and \"Terrain Slopes\" settings.</li>\n<li>Compatible with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Xaero's World Map</a>. By default uses the map textures generated by the world map mod instead of generating its own. This improves performance when using both mods.</li>\n<li>Option to limit your minimap access by binding it to an item required in your hotbar or to be equipped. For example, add <em>minimapItemId:minecraft:compass</em> anywhere in the config file to bind it to the compass item. This way the minimap will not be displayed unless you have the compass in your hotbar or equipped.</li>\n<li>Potion effects to control the usage of the minimap or some of its features for the players on your server/map. The following potion effects exist as of writing this: <em>xaerominimap:no_minimap, xaerominimap:no_entity_radar, xaerominimap:no_waypoints, xaerominimap:no_cave_maps. </em>The effects are of the neutral type by default, but you can also specify a harmful type by appending <em>_harmful</em>&nbsp;to the end of the effect ID, for example&nbsp;<em>xaerominimap:no_entity_radar_harmful</em>.</li>\n<li>Translated to a lot of languages.</li>\n<li>Option to&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">lock north</strong>&nbsp;to stop the minimap from rotating and instead display the direction of your character with an arrow.</li>\n<li>Works both above and under ground thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>automatic cave mode</strong>. Cave mode should also activate inside buildings. You can choose the size of the \"solid roof\" above you that the mod searches for to activate cave mode. Roof size 3x3 and above should prevent cave mode activation when standing under log blocks while cutting wood.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"bbc\">Waypoints</strong>. Practically an infinite amount. Can be teleported to (permission for teleportation chat command needed). Waypoints are rendered in the game world and displayed on the minimap. You can hide all or specific waypoints. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">B</strong>&nbsp;to create a new waypoint. Press&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">U</strong>&nbsp;to list all the waypoints. In the waypoints list, you can add/edit a single or multiple waypoints, sort them, view waypoints from other sub-worlds/dimensions and much more.</li>\n<li><strong>Local and global waypoints. </strong>To clear the screen from unnecessary waypoints you can create local waypoints that, unlike global ones, are affected by the \"Max WP Draw Distance\" option.

The mod sends a chat command&nbsp;to teleport you to the waypoints, which is <em>/tp @s x y z </em>by default, so appropriate permission is necessary. The vanilla <em>/tp</em> command requires OP status (cheats enabled) but it's possible to have separate permissions for commands on a non-vanilla server with certain plugins installed. The used command can be changed in the minimap settings with the \"Default Teleport Command\" option or per server in the waypoints menu with the \"Teleport Chat Command\" option. Non-vanilla teleportation commands often don't support the selectors such as @s, so you might have to remove it from the configured command. Right-click teleportation on the world map uses its own setting for the command. You can read about it on the world map description page under FAQ.</p>\n<p>If the \"Teleport\" button is disabled, then it can also mean multiple things. The most common reason for this is manually using waypoints from a sub-world that isn't the \"auto\" one but still from the same dimension. If the \"auto\" sub-world isn't what is supposed to be automatically picked on a certain world, then select the correct sub-world and use \"Make Sub-world Auto\" in the waypoints menu Options. This will swap all waypoints data between the 2 sub-worlds and you'll be able to teleport to the waypoints, which are now in your \"auto\" sub-world.</p>\n<p>If the \"auto\" sub-world IS selected but the teleport button is still disabled, then it probably means that teleportation was manually disabled for the server/world. Check the teleportation option in the waypoints menu Options. If it's disabled, you can only enable it through the server-specific config file in the game directory -&gt; XaeroWaypoints. I recommend exiting Minecraft before editing any config files. And make backups from time to time.</p>\n\n### Why are my waypoints no longer shown for a specific server?\n\n<p>Do not panic. It's almost certainly not actually deleted. If you use the world map mod and it has also reset, then please start by restoring it first before dealing with the waypoints. Read the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">\"Why has my world map \"reset\" for a specific server?\"</em>&nbsp;section on the world map&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">description page</a>. Done with that? Please continue reading.</p>\n<p>Start by opening the full waypoint menu. Press U ingame to do so. Check the vanilla controls menu, if the U key doesn't work. Go through the sub-worlds listed in the top-right dropdown menu. All waypoint sub-worlds for the current server address should be there. If none of them have the right waypoints for the world/dimension that you are in,&nbsp;then the server address was likely changed. Find the old server address in the top-<strong class=\"bbc\">LEFT</strong>&nbsp;dropdown menu, select it and do&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make World/Server Auto</em>. You should now be able to find the correct sub-world in the top-right dropdown menu. If the right sub-world is already marked with (auto), which means that the sub-world is automatically selected for your current world/dimension, then you should be good to go. If the wrong sub-world is marked with (auto), then please continue reading.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Using the world map mod?</em></u><br />One of the most common reasons for the wrong sub-world being automatically selected is the incorrect usage of the world map mod in multiplayer (since version 1.6).&nbsp;Make sure you select the correct map for your current world before confirming it. It affects which waypoints are being shown to you. The menu for map selection is on the world map screen, if you click the bottom left icon (unless it's open by default). Consider changing the map selection mode to one of the automatic ones, if it fits the server you're playing on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your currently confirmed map affects which waypoints sub-world in the minimap mod is considered automatic (auto). This allows each created map to have separate waypoints data. At any point in time, you can select and view any non-automatic waypoints sub-world by going to the waypoints menu (press U) and selecting it from top-right dropdown menu. You can make any sub-world automatic for your currently confirmed map by selecting&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Options -&gt; Make Sub-World Auto</em>.</p>\n<p><u><em class=\"bbc\">Not using the world map mod?</u></em>&nbsp;<br />The wrong sub-world being considered (auto) and therefore being automatically selected can be caused by a server plugin changing the behavior of the vanilla compass item and interfering with the mod's \"multiworld\" detection, if you have it enabled (disabled by default). In most such cases the compass item points to your bed instead of the global spawn point. Sleeping in the right bed again should bring everything back for you if sleeping in another one was the cause of the waypoints disappearing.<br />If this happened because of a new plugin being added (and if removing it is not an option for you), then here's how you can restore your waypoints:</p>\n<p>1. Find the right waypoints \"sub-world\" from the top-right dropdown menu in the waypoints screen, it's the one with the waypoints that you need in your current dimension. Perhaps start with overworld?</p>\n<p>2. Use&nbsp;<em>Options -&gt; Make sub-world auto.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>3. Do the same for every dimension (enter the dimensions before doing it!).</p>\n<p>4. If it's a simple server with 1 world (no hub/lobby worlds, no minigame worlds, creative plot worlds etc), then also turn off \"Multiworld Detection\" in the same&nbsp;<em>Options&nbsp;</em>menu. You can turn it back on later if you ever need it.<br /><br /><em style=\"font-size: 1.2rem;\">Contact me if you have questions!</em></p>\n\n### How do I add my own entity icons or override the default ones?\n\n<p><strong>First of all, make sure that you actually have the entity icons/heads enabled in the minimap settings -&gt; Entity Radar Categories, whether you put it on \"Always\" or \"Player List\". Just make sure that you know how to display them. Those are the icons that this section is about.</strong></p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.6.0 of the minimap mod you are able to override the default icons displayed for entities with your own sprites/images by making a resource pack (or including the required resources in your own mod). In addition to that, you are also able to add or improve entity type variants support (different variants of the same entity type having different icons) by creating a simple mod of your own or including some code in your existing mod. Although this is usually unnecessary for simpler multi-variant entity types (most entity types).<br />By default, the minimap mod renders all entity icons using the entity renderers/models bound to the entities. This supports all vanilla mobs and some simple bipedal/quadrupedal mobs whose models have easily identifiable head model parts (head, ears, nose etc). If the mod fails to do so, the colored dot is displayed instead.</p>\n<p>The relevant assets directory to the purpose of overriding the icons is&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/</em>. You can find it inside the minimap mod's jar file and extract the contained files/folders for your reference. The jar contains an example file for overriding icons of a mod entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>. The example file would corresponds to the entity type&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_mod:example_entity</em>, if such existed. Please read the comments in the file&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;to learn about its structure, so that you are able to create your own icon definitions similar to it.<br />In addition to that,&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/minecraft/</em>&nbsp;contains several example files for vanilla entity types that might require additional comments regarding the default entity type variants support. By default, entities have very simple variants support where the entity type variant ID is simply the entity's main texture resource location.<br />If you set the \"<em>debugEntityVariantIds</em>\" option in the minimap config file to true, then the variant IDs of newly encountered entities (variants) will be printed in the chat and the log/console.</p>\n<p>Starting from version 21.8.0 of the minimap mod you are also able to configure your own model-based rendering. Please read the comments in the example file&nbsp;<em>/assets/xaerominimap/entity/icon/definition/example_mod/example_entity.json</em>&nbsp;for all the information you need to know.</p>\n<p>Check out this awesome project by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/babybluetit\">babybluetit</a>, if you want to have a look at a real implementation of custom icons or actually use it:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support\">https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/xaeros-minimap-modded-support</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>You are allowed to make videos using this mod.</strong></em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong>Using it in your modpacks is allowed with the following conditions: </strong></em></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #800080;\"><em><strong><b><i>Only monetization of the modpack through CurseForge or Modrinth is allowed (which includes sponsored links/banners in your modpack description), unless I have given you written permission to monetize it elsewhere.

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names. Check the <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Minecraft Wiki</strong></span></a> for more information on formatting codes.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/27/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/28/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anvils can be so fancy!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Free name tag renames</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/29/2022-09-29_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/30/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No max level limit anymore</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>No anvil required for renaming name tags anymore</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/422/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/424/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Repair anvils by one stage using iron blocks</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use formatting codes when naming your equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want enchanting tables to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Magic</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before 1.17?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Check out the mods which inspired this project: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Tweaks</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-repair\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Repair</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nametags-without-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nametags Without Anvils</span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>tfarecnim</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

[1.19.2] EasyAnvils-v4.0.11","version_number":"v4.0.11-1.19.2-Forge","changelog":"# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v4.0.11-1.19.3] - 2023-04-20\n### Fixed\n- The anvil menu no longer looses items after it has remained open when the anvil has just been damaged\n\n## [v4.0.10-1.19.2] - 2023-03-15\n### Changed\n- Renaming / repairing no longer accounts for the prior work penalty of an item\n- The 'Too Expensive!' limit is now disabled by default once more\n- Overhauled server config file\n  - Separated all options into three categories\n  - Added a few new options for controlling different costs, like multipliers for enchantment rarities and repairs\n  - Improved many descriptions to hopefully be easier to understand\n### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue where the 'Too Expensive!' label wouldn't show\n\n## [v4.0.9-1.19.2] - 2023-03-10\n### Changed\n- Easy Anvils now internally converts formatted item names to Minecraft's component based text format for saving instead of saving raw strings using the legacy chat formatting format\n- This change should help with other mods that see `§` as an invalid character in item names, causing issues\n- Overhauled the anvil rename edit box with a lot of useful text manipulation features, included as an experimental feature to test as a possible future standalone text box enhancement mod\n- Most features are modelled after text handling on macOS, not everything is implemented yet (notably missing right now is double-click+dragging to select individual words)\n  - Right-click the edit box to clear\n  - Double-click a word to select that word\n  - Triple-click anywhere in the box to select everything\n  - Click+drag across text to select all characters dragged above\n  - `Alt`+`Delete` to delete the word left of the cursor\n  - `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`Delete` to delete all characters left of the cursor\n  - `Alt`+`Left Arrow`/`Right Arrow` to move between words\n  - `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`Left Arrow`/`Right Arrow` to move to the beginning/end of the text box\n  - `Shift`+`Alt`+`Left Arrow`/`Right Arrow` to select individual words\n  - `Shift`+`Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`Left Arrow`/`Right Arrow` to select everything to the beginning/end of the text box\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a crash when right-clicking anvils on Forge for real this time\n- Fixed a crash when entering Emojis into the anvil rename / name tag edit box\n- Fixed the anvil rename / name tag edit box allowing fewer characters than vanilla when formatting codes are used\n\n## [v4.0.8-1.19.2] - 2023-03-07\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a crash when right-clicking anvils on Forge introduced in the last version\n\n## [v4.0.7-1.19.2] - 2023-03-06\n### Changed\n- Easy Anvil now is much more careful when applying any changes to anvil mechanics in regard to other mods\n- All changes to those mechanics from any other mod take precedence (like a new anvil recipe), Easy Anvils only takes effect if the outcome would be the same as vanilla\n- This change is necessary to offer out-of-the-box compatibility with many mods which previously broke due to Easy Anvils\n\n## [v4.0.6-1.19.2] - 2022-11-15\n### Fixed\n- Fixed compatibility with Apotheosis (Forge) and Things (Fabric) mod\n\n## [v4.0.5-1.19.2] - 2022-10-19\n### Fixed\n- Fixed compatibility with Ledger mod\n\n## [v4.0.4-1.19.2] - 2022-10-18\n### Fixed\n- Fixed modded anvil operations always costing only a single enchantment level\n\n## [v4.0.3-1.19.2] - 2022-10-18\n### Changed\n- The mod no longer changes modded anvils in any way since they usually feature significant differences from the vanilla anvil\n- Overhauled how changes to the anvil mechanic are applied, should no longer interfere with other mods on Forge (Fabric mods will need dedicated integration unfortunately, see `fuzs.easyanvils.api.event.AnvilUpdateCallback`)\n- Reworked prior work penalty changes:\n  - Costs are now set at a fixed increase (4 levels, configurable) per previous anvil operation which scales way less aggressively compared to vanilla. They can still be completely disabled in the config as it was before.\n  - Renaming and just repairing will not increase the prior work penalty at all, when the max anvil level limit is exceeded those operations are still possible.\n\n## [v4.0.2-1.19.2] - 2022-10-13\n### Changed\n- Renaming any item is now free and will not increase the prior work penalty, there is a config setting to change this back to only apply for name tags\n\n## [v4.0.1-1.19.2] - 2022-10-03\n### Added\n- Added ability to use formatting codes in anvils and the new name tag interface; allows for stylizing item and entity names\n- Find out more on the Minecraft Wiki: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\n\n## [v4.0.0-1.19.2] - 2022-09-29\n- Initial release\n\n[Keep a Changelog]:

After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/visual-workbench-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does this work with crafting tables from other mods?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it does, but support has to be manually enabled per block. Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game). If you add a crafting table yourself and it doesn't work it is likely incompatible with this mod.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Now that items stay in the table, clearing the interface is so tedious. What can I do?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Try <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafting-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Crafting Tweaks</span></a>, a mod by <a

This comes out as caupona. PS: Caupona and Thermopolium are both independent, their contents won't be migrate to each other.\n\nAside cooking, we also added a hypocaust bath system.\n\nWe support patchouli books and JEI.\n\n## A new major update version 0.4 for 1.19.2 and above!\n\nWe do a lot of user survey and added some new interesting features:\n\nLead, a brand new mid-game material with a special ability to grant a special effect into foods.

They are located in plains, hills and forest. Fig and wolfberry tree are bush, they don't produce wood and only yield sticks. Walnut has corresponding wood, planks and a serie of wooden products. They would grow fruits under their leaves. Fig is fruit and wolfberry is berry. Walnut serves as oil crops\n#### Volcanic Fumarole\n\n![fumarole](https://i.postimg.cc/XYHn5rM0/ZKb-Wl-Ps-Rtp-QHn5j.png)\n\nGenerates in desert and extreme hills, consists of a small basalt plate, a fumarole vent and some decorative fumarole boulder. The second block below it decides its properties.\nIf lava, it would generate pumice bloom on nearby water and provides heat.\nIf magma block, it would provide heat but have no other effects.\nIf others, it have no effect.\nNatural volcanic fumarole can be one of above. fumarole vent should be picked with silk touch, or it would drop basalt instead.\n### Building Materials\n\n![Materials](https://i.postimg.cc/fbzL1VfC/XJzu-Hg-Q9asyb-CAl.png)\n\nThis mod provides a few new building materials, they are: mixed bricks, walnut planks, opus reticulatum, felsic tuff bricks, fumarole bloom, thin brick(crafting material), opus latericium, opus incertum, felsic tuff, pumice. Except pumice, pumice bloom and thin bricks as material, they all have slab, stair and wall variant. Pumice is gathered from picking pumice bloom.\n\n![Columns](https://i.postimg.cc/dtC94V6D/Inzc-ZASMqb5k-Dh-B.png)\n\nAnd three different types of Greko-Roman columns are provided. They have variants of felsic tuff, calcite, stone or quartz.\n\n![Kitchen](https://i.postimg.cc/NMfckVwf/Crx-YMXdz-B3-Sj64-V.png)\n\nFive different types of kitchen materials: stone bricks, opus latericium, opus incertum, bricks and mud. Kitchen counter serves as decoration but other blocks have different use.\n### Cooking\n#### Stove\n\n![stove](https://i.postimg.cc/mDXGXwb3/lk2-PAEGCaj-Uwsc-J.png)\n\nStoves are basic heat providing device. Their appearance would change depend on its fuel. Both stoves and volcanic fumarole serves as heat source, but their heat level is different. Heat level decides how fast heat consuming device would work.\n#### Stew Pot\n\n![Stew Pot Gui](https://i.postimg.cc/j5QhtgWN/HPEm8-QRz-T4-MXs-SJ.png)\n\nStew pot is a cooking device only needed to provide ingredient and fluid to cook stews. Raw ingredients supported and they would be cook automatically. Basically, recipes only decide stews' appearance and have no extra effect, actual effect only depends on the ingredients. Specially, Stock based stews can become aspics when left still for a long time. Cooking foods into soup can provide a relatively high saturation modifier depends on its concerntration. Potions can also added to stews in cooking. Stews can be re-cooked as many as you wish, if you are not satisfy with it and wanted to make something else.Use container at stew pots to drain fluid inside, while sneak and use with empty hand clear its fluid contents. \n#### Aspic and Portable Brazier\n\n![Aspics](https://i.postimg.cc/T3LqpYLT/v-Xo-SIq-O3e-EHa-ZC5.png)\n\nAspics are useful in storing or carring stews, they are not edible. Cook and thaw them in stew pots or portable brazier to turn it back to soup. Turning aspics to soup or soups to aspics preserves its effects.\n\n![Portable Brazier](https://i.postimg.cc/qR08bsm7/u-VA5-BZd-Knmikaj6.png)\n\nPortable Brazier requires water bowl and portable fuel(vivid charcoal, magma cream, etc) to melt aspics back to soup. However, stew pot does not need water to perform this operation.\n#### Frying Pan\n\n![Frying Pan](https://i.postimg.cc/3RKt4QQ9/Oq-C849-Hi-Jyg-Lp-Wl.png)\n\n![Frying Pan UI](https://i.postimg.cc/L55vDkX1/cqs-USgz1i-CP4265.png)\n\nWith frying pans, you can make stir fry. Frying requires oil in gravy boats beside the pan, and enough containers(bowl). About two ingredients turns into a dish. Still, frying can cook raw ingredient. Pans can be made of stone, copper or iron. They have no major difference. Frying would provide moderate saturation modifier and cooks much faster than cooking stew. But potion can not be added and you can't re-cook any dish.\n#### Dolium\n\n![Dolium](https://i.postimg.cc/NFnDzy9P/Ca8-Yq-Igzn-Ey-BMAm.png)\n\nCounter with dolium can store a small amount of liquids.\n\n![Dolium UI](https://i.postimg.cc/XN9wMzMY/E5f94pmys-Ux6rd-H.png)\n\nIt can also handle resting convertion. It takes 600s to perform an action. But it would produce as much as it can in one single time.\nResting convertion includes aspic making. However, recipes without extra ingredient like stew to aspic can also done with stew pot.\nIf stews stored inside dolium, spices can be added during draining stew.\n#### Spice\n\n![Spice](https://i.postimg.cc/VL1XzW1B/edf-Msgzab-ROWt-Pn.png)\n\nSpices are spice in flower pot, they are made of materials above. They are chives, garum, vinegar, sugar. Adding spice into stews or sauteed food can add an short extra potion effect onto it. If stews with spice are re-cooked, they lost their spice.\n#### Decoration\n\n![Placed Foods](https://i.postimg.cc/kXcKGRgr/pm-ZN1-BHFER6t78q.png)\n\nSneak+use to place dishes on the world. Use at placed dishes to eat them. Also, pots and pans would show their contents. \n\n![Chimneys](https://i.postimg.cc/pLL8FVmm/uv-N1-Cc35-Ldsyw-Sg.png)\n\nChimneys consists of vertical placed chimney flues and an optional chimney pot at the top. Their length is varied and materials does not need to match. It can transfer smoke from stoves or other smoking device. It can transfer smoke from smoking devices in 3 blocks below it. But there shouldn't be any solid blocks between them. When used with stove, chimney pot above it can gradually accumulates ash, that can use as a material for dyes. Use shovels to gather them. \n\n### Hypocaust Bathing\n\n![Hypocaust](https://i.postimg.cc/Rhzmk0kG/XMo-Dsqr-Tah-ZB7jy.png)\n\nHypocaust blocks, the left four are hypocaust firebox, others are hypocaust caliduct.\n\n![Firebox](https://i.postimg.cc/Hn4mdgHm/r-Vg-SAHf3-PWQl-BTZ.png)\n\nHypocaust firebox accept heat from heat sources and propagates heat to caliducts in a 9x9 area. Their materials don't need to be match. And chimney can transfer smoke from hypocaust firebox.\nHypocaust blocks heat water on it and turns them into bath water and steam coming out from it. Players stay inside bath water can gradually gain experience.\n\n![Wolf statue states](https://i.postimg.cc/ZYr4rrNQ/vhx9gbi-Xe-FRL4-VQ.png)\n\n![Wolf statue range](https://i.postimg.cc/65cKPtYL/Uu-REecb-Dg-VJHf-Z1.png)\n\nCopper wolf statue is some sort of thermometer. It's appearance changes depend on its temperature, it can tell temperature of stoves or hypocaust blocks. When using as hypocaust thermometer, they don't have to placed right on it, but somewhere above it, blocks between wolf statue and hypocaust blocks doesn't matters.\n\n### Automation and Redstone support\n#### Dispenser support\n\n![Dispensers](https://i.postimg.cc/28RdtfV6/gvw-AJUVbu-Sj-P9-Z2.png)\n\nStew pots and pans can be set to redstone control, a single signal would cause it to work for once. Since its bottom should be heated by heat source, so hoppers is useless in taking out its products. So we introduce dispenser support.Dispenser support:\nWith bowls inside, it can drain fluid from pots or world, and draw output from pans.\nWith fluid buckets or bowl of stew inside, it can pour the fluid into stew pots or doliums.\nWith gravy boats inside, it can replace the gravy boat in the world to one in its inventory.\nWith spice inside, it would replace spice inside the device with the one inside its inventory.\nWith flower pot inside, it would take out spice from the device.\n#### Comparator support\n\n![Comparator](https://i.postimg.cc/4N6vkF91/M3-Xf-VZGSLTapgq-U.png)\n\nFull dishes emits signal, while empty ones does not.\nGravy bot emits signal based on how much use remaining, 3 for each use.\nStew pots emits signal only when it is idle. It outputs sum of ingredient and bowls of liquids inside, plus 1.\nPans emits signal only when it is idle. It outputs sum of ingredient plus 1. If its output slots are blocked, outputs 15.\nWolf statue emits signal based on its heat level, if directly heated by stove, output 9. And the value would add 3 for each heat level.\n\n### Mod Support\n- Farmers' delight\n- simple farming\n- crock pot\n- and other mod ingrendients with proper food tags.\n\n### Datapack and Extension support\nAll of our recipes and process can be changed or added through datapack. Most of features are configurable. \nWe have a tag based system and it's easy to make new supports. We also have many convenient apis to get things work.\n\n### Author\n\nThis project are presented by Teammoeg members:\n\nDeveloper: khjxiaogu\n\nArtist: Lyuuke\n\n### Modpack usage\n\nFeel free to use this mod in any of modpacks, or modify for specific use.\n","published":"2023-07-15T19:02:20.042996Z","updated":"2023-08-29T09:03:44.784507Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":912,"followers":15,"categories":["decoration","food","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["njhaGLgG","JQpEcgQ8","dMBwSOdh","T2A3n3Ny","BioXa03K"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EFoYZIZL/2a2adb9768c4d99f7b35931a1f1feaf75c16be81.png"},"version":{"id":"JQpEcgQ8","project_id":"EFoYZIZL","author_id":"iZWfgc25","featured":false,"name":"Caupona 1.19.2-0.2.7","version_number":"1.19.2-0.2.7","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-15T19:23:05.861079Z","downloads":169,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"42b5ef290bd1f7dbfe14e56bed7131b19ee65b938eb34c9320e6f9c1fb4503aa9d29a8fbb5fb19f464e081049c632ca9c9a3c08b647054887c1c0af01613e365","sha1":"090b5ccca55dca80facd7c12705609ce6158c558"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EFoYZIZL/versions/JQpEcgQ8/caupona-1.19.2-0.2.7.jar","filename":"caupona-1.19.2-0.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":1818849,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"62ztr7HA","project_id":"nU0bVIaL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"YWrLRDfT","project_id":"u6dRKJwZ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Z6rPXCYk","user":{"id":"iZWfgc25","username":"khjxiaogu","name":"khj xiaogu","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54445543?v=4","bio":"Modder, Developer, Artist and so on.","created":"2023-07-15T18:58:49.263430Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"caupona-1.19.2-0.2.7.jar"},"mods\\auudio_forge_1.0.3_MC_1.19-1.19.2.jar":{"sha512":"97ec574afd824fe4a2b2746369742eb3429f34b3a786c5250a750b77a8184a283c856cd35f8a6515b7dce504ef3b6d73b2d3e4fb93f75eb5dc1981059ca00d15","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"FCr31KmZ","slug":"auudio","project_type":"mod","team":"Ngcycboc","title":"Auudio","description":"Library mod to easily play background sound in menus and worlds.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://discord.gg/UzmeWkD\"><img src=\"https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/704163135787106365/widget.png?style=banner2\" /></a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keksuccino\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/132924153-df28357d-6816-48a2-96a8-594333d3b075.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/keksuccino\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/132924155-25fe4269-5936-4cac-88cf-5d6069e0443a.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://paypal.me/TimSchroeter\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/132924156-ec4300ea-7e10-40de-a271-8effb8fbf5cf.png\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Fabric\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (Only for Fabric)\n\n## About\n\n**THIS MOD DOES NOTHING ON ITS OWN!

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-10-31T07:08:36.481240Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2031279,"followers":3818,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"CtXsUUz6","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"5.0.3 (Forge)","version_number":"5.0.3-forge","changelog":"- Fix crash when the stream returned by `getResourceAsStream` does not return the full file at once\n  - This has only happened on Quilt in practice, but could also happen in future Forge versions","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-11-26T16:46:57.826246Z","downloads":50303,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"dd553aad3900f01a9924e906516ec6a74e671319e091bd9b37974e2cf11b00d5cfb1faa6a883c5c413d966696ed5e1d987de3d9cbe862ae9f13f48463d0f16b7","sha1":"59245ec84ca1e3639237f5a04fe6f7556a9ec2bb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/CtXsUUz6/ferritecore-5.0.3-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-5.0.3-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":116824,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-5.0.3-forge.jar"},"mods\\BetterCompatibilityChecker-1.0.7-build.35+mc1.19.2.jar":{"sha512":"d5b0201a9e1baf6764bf2763bb31a09b39a28a60271192a9f5ade2768846fb97f98daec1011f9c9cafceabfb47c29597922b95aa372092c39e9a897f87d95313","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"KJhXPbHQ","slug":"better-compatibility-checker","project_type":"mod","team":"jpzbybUh","title":"Better Compatibility Checker","description":"Changes the default server compatibility check to compare modpack versions","body":"The forge server compatibility checker is not always accurate and can cause some issues with end-users of a modpack when they add a server, and it shows up as not compatible.\n\nThis mod fixes that issue when used by modpacks, as it will compare the modpack project ID and the modpack version ID set in a config file by the modpack author and display a tick if they match or an X if they do not match.\n\n\nBoth server and client are running the same version\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/KJhXPbHQ/images/dcc8da720c8b426be8a5c79363b6f5864428d051.png)\nIncompatible server or client version\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/KJhXPbHQ/images/0ea169b464a63c5c6fa857b8a6b370552781afa3.png)\n\n## How do I configure the mod?\n\nIt's simple to configure the mod, first, you will need to open the bcc-common.toml in the config folder, then you will need to set the modpack name and the modpack version, click save, and you're done.\n\nJust remember to update the version when you update the modpack.\n\n\nNote: Fabric config is named bcc.json\n\n\n## What happens if the mod is not installed on the server, but is on the client?\n\nThis mod will check if the data needed is set first and if it's not it will fall back to using the default forge implementation\n\n---\n\nAll Rights Reserved unless stated otherwise.

style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Neapolitan is&nbsp;a food mod with&nbsp;a different&nbsp;approach. Rather than raw stats, Neapolitan's foods do things to give them each&nbsp;a niche. Neapolitan food is sort of divided by flavors, which all involve exploring the&nbsp;world, rather than purely consisting of crafting recipes. Each flavor has&nbsp;an ice cream, cake&nbsp;and milkshake with it, with 6 out of&nbsp;a planned 9 implemented. The current flavors&nbsp;are vanilla, chocolate, strawberries, bananas, mint and adzuki. Bubblegum, cinnamon and mango are to follow. In&nbsp;addition, the mod tweaks cookies, so they're eaten faster.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7uo5Va.png\" width=\"1344\" height=\"48\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong>📦 Cross-Compatibility:</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"Atmospheric\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/atmospheric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Atmospheric</span></a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Savage &amp; Ravage\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/savage-and-ravage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Savage &amp; Ravage</span></a></li>\n<li><a title=\"Quark\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/quark\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Quark</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7uo5Va.png\" width=\"1344\" height=\"48\" /></p>\n<p><a title=\"Nodecraft\" href=\"https://nodecraft.com/r/abnormals\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oZS1R9g.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"184\" /></a></p>","published":"2023-09-18T17:12:43.569936Z","updated":"2023-11-03T07:11:25.928301Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":607,"followers":33,"categories":["decoration","food","mobs"],"additional_categories":["adventure","utility"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["QnuadvVU","ZcPrNgdK","8qmVV9M7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/InYMuiQt/7d37bccf6e93b11f55d39e28fc810d257d2334cb.png"},"version":{"id":"8qmVV9M7","project_id":"InYMuiQt","author_id":"q5duvarF","featured":false,"name":"Neapolitan 4.1.0","version_number":"4.1.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-03T07:11:26.652464Z","downloads":339,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7342bf81fa5b521cb8788acf0a460e195242ee304c226f3f38fa8ff509d700032acacc9e654bd557248a6e6c03b5e85168718740daa676aa4f3cd5daebf14717","sha1":"a2d046d05a395d17550b19227696fd62a7380985"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/InYMuiQt/versions/8qmVV9M7/neapolitan-1.19.2-4.1.0.jar","filename":"neapolitan-1.19.2-4.1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":4622705,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"VsM5EDoI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"9kFv1N98","user":{"id":"q5duvarF","username":"TeamAbnormals","name":"teamabnormals","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/q5duvarF/eba25e566c8678da285243ac416844c84dc7ef9d.png","bio":"We're a modding team dedicated to creating with high-quality art and design for modern Minecraft versions!","created":"2023-09-18T16:48:51.416757Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"9kFv1N98","user":{"id":"3u8PgG8F","username":"bagel","name":"bagel","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/3u8PgG8F/3c735084680f47dea218cca869655cfc245cd051.png","bio":"minecraft modder and coder and yeaher","created":"2021-04-29T17:41:22.849292Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"9kFv1N98","user":{"id":"sDU3igNJ","username":"martianarchitecture","name":"martianarchitecture","avatar_url":null,"bio":null,"created":"2023-09-19T09:42:32.182205Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"9kFv1N98","user":{"id":"DUKH8u24","username":"five","name":"five","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/DUKH8u24/863cf73aa020a35f827bb4bf69acfb1c321b4f0a.png","bio":"fire trucks and moster trucks\n\nfive","created":"2023-09-18T17:20:55.866125Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"neapolitan-1.19.2-4.1.0.jar"},"mods\\curios-forge-1.19.2-5.1.4.2.jar":{"sha512":"523c90b9c9f6a84872fa6edc4553aabbea76b59a8f717294a8a9847893655dfa6658c65a77fedee078d79a620646dd22cd1b5b985dd2b787e4ad4a9e14a1c801","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"vvuO3ImH","slug":"curios","project_type":"mod","team":"JCm9vxVF","title":"Curios API","description":"A flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers.","body":"Curios is a flexible and expandable accessory/equipment API for users and developers. The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [How to Use: Users](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Users)\n* [How to Use: Developers](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/How-to-Use:-Developers)\n* [Commands](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Commands)\n* [Frequently Used Slots](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki/Frequently-Used-Slots)\n* [Adding to Your Project](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios#adding-to-your-project)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2023-11-26T10:36:07.743544Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":146785,"followers":172,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP","opCpnbhi","8zBiV8Xc","SdxNj4Fa","BKMikxx0","NI17MAnS","nEba8UUT","9fDBKv2o","wOH4YWOv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"BKMikxx0","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-1.19.2-5.1.4.2","version_number":"1.19.2-5.1.4.2","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

If that's not enough: you can upgrade your wand with additional cores, allowing you to place a block behind the\nblock you are facing, conjure blocks in mid air or destroy lots of blocks very fast.\n\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/bV2crgLh/images/c9dc4b40da63d535f90020335804e089addb5896.png)\n\n**Note:** These are the instructions for ConstructionWand version 2.0+, which introduced some new features.\nIf you are still using version 1.x, refer to [those](https://github.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/tree/1.16.2-1.7)\ninstructions.\n\n## Wands\n\nThere are basic wands made from stone, iron and diamond and the Infinity wand. Wands from higher tiers are more powerful\nand last longer. These properties can be changed in the config.\n\n| Wand     | Durability  | Max. Blocks | Upgradeable | Angel distance | Max. Blocks (Destroy) |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Stone    | 131         | 9           | No          | -              | -                     |\n| Iron     | 250         | 27          | Yes         | 1              | 9                     |\n| Diamond  | 1561        | 128         | Yes         | 4              | 25                    |\n| Infinity | Unbreakable | 1024        | Yes         | 8              | 81                    |\n\n## Crafting\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting1.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting2.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting3.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting4.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting5.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/crafting6.png)\n\n## Keybindings\n\nTo change a wand's core and options or undo your placement you need to hold down the wand option key\n(refered as OPTKEY). By default, this is CTRL, but it can be changed in the client config file. To prevent unwanted\nchanges to your options, you can configure that you have to hold down SNEAK as well to change options or open up the\nGUI.\n\n## Wand cores\n\nWand cores are magical gemstones that make your wand do its thing.\n\nEvery wand comes with a Construction core. You can make your wand even better by putting\naditional cores into it. Put your new core together with your wand in a\ncrafting grid to install it. To switch between cores, hold down OPTKEY and left click empty space\nwith your wand.\nStone wands can't be upgraded.\n\n**Construction core**\n\nExtend your build on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nHold down OPTKEY and scroll to change placement restriction\n(Horizontal, Vertical, North/South, East/West, No lock).\n\n**Angel core**\n\nPlace a block on the opposite side of the block (or row of blocks) you are facing. Maximum distance depends\non wand tier. Right click empty space to place a block in midair (similar to angel blocks, hence the name).\nTo do that, you'll need to have the block you want to place in your offhand. You can't place a block in midair\nif you've fallen more than 10 blocks deep (no easy rescue tool from falling into the void).\n\n**Destruction core**\n\nDestroy blocks (no tile entities) on the side facing you. Maximum number of blocks depends on wand tier.\nRestrictions work just like with the Construction core. Destroyed blocks disappear into the void,\nyou can use the undo feature if you've made a mistake.\n\n## Options\nSNEAK+OPTKEY+Right clicking empty space opens the option screen of your wand.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/options.png)\n\n**Restriction:** If restriction is enabled the wand will only place blocks in one row or column\n(choose between North/South, East/West on a horizontal plane and Horizontal, Vertical on a vertical plane).\nIf the direction lock is switched off, the wand will extend the entire face of the building it's pointed at. This option\nhas no effect if the angel core is enabled.\n\n**Direction:** If set to \"Player\" the wand places blocks in the same direction as if they were placed by yourself.\nTarget mode places the blocks in the same direction as their supporting block. See the picture below:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Theta-Dev/ConstructionWand/1.19/images/placedir.png)\n\n**Replacement:** Enables/disables the replacement of replaceable blocks (Fluids, snow, tallgrass).\n\n**Matching:** Select which blocks are extended by the wand. If set to \"EXACT\" it will only extend blocks that\nare exactly the same as the selected block.<br>\n\"SIMILAR\" will treat similar blocks equally (e.g. extend dirt and grass blocks).<br>\n\"ANY\" will extend any block on the face of the building you're looking at.\n\n**Random:** If random mode is enabled, the wand places random blocks from your hotbar.<br>\n~~Shamelessly stolen~~ Inspired by the Trowel from Quark.\n\n## Undo\n\nHolding down Sneak+OPTKEY while looking at a block will show you the last blocks you placed with a green border around\nthem. Sneak+OPTKEY+Right clicking any of them will undo the operation, giving you all the items back. If you used the\nDestruction core, it will restore the blocks.\n\n## Additional features\n\n- Shulker boxes, bundles (MC 1.17+) and many containers from other mods can provide building blocks for the wand\n\n- Botania compatibility: The Black Hole Talisman can supply blocks just like shulker boxes can.

It holds a lot to explore and to gather, but nothing comes without a risk. Especially at night.</li>\n<li>Mushroom Grave: an overgrown grave, spawning in swamps, jungles and mushroom islands.</li>\n<li>Memorial Birch Tree: an imposing tree found in birch forests.</li>\n<li>Large Graveyard: an immense jigsaw structure generating in forests. But be warned - it is full of dangers.</li>\n<li>Crypt: an expansive labyrinth, full of traps, loot and dangers, hidden in the depths.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Boss - Corrupted Champion</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Corrupted Champion is the entombed remnant of an unknown hero, fallen into corruption. Its power arise from its bone staff, which was crafted from the bones of its innocent victims. With its power, the lich can controll the minds of its enemies and turn peaceful beings into abominations fighting along its side. But beware. Even if you manage to drain the staff's corruption, the fight isn't over.</li>\n\n \n<li>Phases:</li>\n\nSpell phase abilities: Bone Vortex Attack, Skull Cast Attack, Levitation Spell, Falling Corpses Spell, Summon Minions Spell, Labyrinth Heal Attack. </br>\nHunt phase abilities: Darkness encases the player while the Lich hunts its prey. Don't let it come to close.</br>\nDeformation phase.\n\n\n<li>How to summon the Corrupted Champion:</li>\n\nCollect the three bone staff pieces (Ominous Bone Staff Fragment) from the Ruins structure. Every Ruin has a unique fragment (upper, middle and lower bone staff fragment).</br>\nObtain a bone dagger from an Acolyte, or craft it yourself.</br>\nHold a glass bottle in your offhand and start killing villager with the bone dagger. You'll get a Vial of Blood. Fill the vial to the limit.</br>\nFind the Lich Prison structure, a large floating island above the oceans.</br>\nWait until it is night, place the bone staff pieces (from upper to lower) on the dark corrupted deepslate blocks in front of the altar (they should fairly stand out).</br>\nPour the Vial of Blood into the altar.</br>\n\nVoilà, you unleashed pure evil into the world, probably causing the death of thousands of innocent people and very likely your own.\n</ul>\n\n<h2> Mobs </h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Skeleton Creeper: a faster undead variant of the creeper. It may has lost his destructive powers, but its haunting appearance will blind you.</li>\n<li>Acolyte: a darker representative of the illager family. If he'll find you, your bones will serve him as a new weapon.</li>\n<li>Reaper: Ghosts? Here, in a spooky graveyard mod? No... The reaper takes this place.</li>\n<li>Ghoul: a deformed revenant, hold together only by his rage on the living.</li>\n<li>Revenant: the animated remains of a once human being.</li>\n<li>Nightmare: a deformed creature that moves quicker than it seems.

A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

Well, _all parts_.<br>\nAt least in most vanilla menus you can customize basically everything:\n\n- Hide, move and resize vanilla buttons and change their button background textures and labels\n- Add custom buttons to open links, to send messages and _so_ much more\n- Add text elements and change their text color, scale, etc.\n- Add images and GIFs\n- Change the menu background to an image, slideshow, custom cubic panorama or even an animation\n- Play custom background music in menus (set different music tracks per menu!)\n- Use \"loading requirements\" to show/hide menu elements under specific conditions\n- And so, so much more!\n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/Keksuccino/JustZoom/assets/35544624/d3bc9596-e483-47d9-acec-94552434b1d2\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" /></p>\n\n[**DOWNLOAD CAVE ANIMATION**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/fancymenu-minecraft-cave-animation)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFancyMenu has a lot of features and I really recommend you to read the [wiki](https://fm.keksuccino.dev) to fully understand it, but there's also a video series about how to use the mod. It's still **very much recommended** to read the wiki, but sometimes watching a video is just more convenient, so here you go:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"

It also gives server owners powerful controls over their players' usage of the mod's features.\n\nThe mod's API allows other mods or plugins to easily interact with the parties and the chunk claims, both on the server and the client side. The mod already integrates with [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) and [World Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) mods. Make sure to update them to the latest versions.\n\nThe API of the mod allows the implementation of player permission systems to be used by the mod for some permission nodes (e.g. for having rank-based claim limits), with Prometheus, FTB Ranks, LuckPerms and the Forge/Fabric permission APIs having built-in support. It also allows the implementation of party systems to be used by claims alongside or instead of the default party system, with Argonauts and FTB Teams having built-in support. The default party system or claims can be disabled completely in the main config file.\n\n## Commands:\n/openpac ... - player config commands\n\n/openpac-claims ... - everything claim-related\n\n/openpac-parties ... - everything party-related\n\n/opm - shortcut for the party chat\n\n## Key Bindings:\n' - open the mod UI. Can be changed in the controls menu.\n\n## Configs:\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml - the main mod config. Make sure to shut down the server before editing it, or the server might overwrite all your changes.\n\n[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-... - some global \"player configs\", although all of them can be accessed in game through the UI\n\n## FAQ\n### 1) How do I configure the mod on my server?\nThe mod is mainly configured through the main config file at _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, or sometimes _[server directory]/config/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_ on Fabric/Quilt, while the server isn't running. Server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, can be edited by OPs in-game with the UI (check your key bindings). Normal players can configure their own player config with the same UI. If the mod isn't installed on the client side, then you can use the player config chat commands instead.\n\n### 2) How do I use this mod as a regular player?\nMost things related to claims can be accessed with the in-game UI (check your key bindings). If you have the Xaero's World Map mod installed, you can view and edit your claims on the map screen as well, by right-clicking on the map or dragging with the right mouse button to make a selection. You can also use chat commands to make/edit claims. Parties can only be created and managed through chat commands at the moment.\n\n### 3) Why are some options greyed out in my player config?\nThe server admin/owner can configure with the main config file option _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_ which specific options players have access to. Everything else uses the value in the default player config.\n\n### 4) How do I disable all protection on my server?\nIn the server claim, expired claim and wilderness configs, as well as the default player config, disable the main protection option. Next, edit the config file _[world directory]/serverconfig/openpartiesandclaims-server.toml_, while the server isn't running. Remove the main option _claims.protectClaimedChunks_ from _playerConfigurablePlayerConfigOptions_.\n\n## Supported Mods:\nA lot of (usually smaller) mods should be supported by the claimed chunk protection automatically. Some mods go above and beyond with the mechanics they add to the game or modify, in which case chunk protection is not guaranteed and should be manually added, either to this mod or with an additional one. Feel free to leave suggestions on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/thexaero/open-parties-and-claims/issues) for the mods that you'd like to be supported.

Tugs can also be dragged with leads, right click on the hook at the back of the boat to attach.\n\nTransport your items and fluids, or fish automatically using any existing natural waterways or create your own!\n\n## Trains - Locomotives and cars (Little Logistics 1.2+)\n\nSmall trains that can be linked together and transport items and fluids.

white-space: pre;\"><strong>This guide should only be used if you are a developer wanting to using Blueprint in your mod. If you're a player, you may disregard this guide.</strong><br />Adding Blueprint to your mod is quite simple! First off you need to add Blueprint as a dependency to access the library in code. To do so, add the following into your <code>build.gradle</code>: <br /><br /><code>\nrepositories {<br />\n    maven {<br />\n        url = \"https://maven.jaackson.me\"<br />\n    }<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\ndependencies {<br />\n    implementation fg.deobf(\"com.teamabnormals:blueprint:&lt;version&gt;\")<br />\n}\n      </code><br /> <br />Next you need to add it as a dependecy on Forge to make your mod require Blueprint when loading. In your <code>mods.toml</code> add the following block to the file:<br /><br /><code>\n[[dependencies.&lt;modId&gt;]]<br />\n    modId = \"blueprint\"<br />\n    mandatory = true<br />\n    versionRange = \"[&lt;version&gt;,)\"<br />\n    ordering = \"BEFORE\"<br />\n    side = \"BOTH\"\n      </code><br /><br />Replace <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> in the examples above with the version on you want. For example, <code>1.17.1-4.0.0</code> will give us <code>blueprint-1.17.1-4.0.0.jar</code>. The example for the <code>mods.toml</code> is targeting the version selected and any versions beyond. If you want to target it differently, you may want to read up on the <code>mods.toml</code> spec. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7uo5Va.png\" width=\"1344\" height=\"48\" /></p>\n<p><a title=\"Nodecraft\" href=\"https://nodecraft.com/r/abnormals\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/oZS1R9g.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"184\" /></a></p>","published":"2023-09-18T17:11:12.586856Z","updated":"2023-11-03T22:12:07.276432Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":2125,"followers":29,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["LeFEEsj6","SnLXbWe9","W7LnjQML","aCCwv4Kz","mnMEKjNd","fEmF971j","L7ot1xtH"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VsM5EDoI/9311df94e37aa2c7a39cce14d118a263862fe9e5.png"},"version":{"id":"SnLXbWe9","project_id":"VsM5EDoI","author_id":"q5duvarF","featured":true,"name":"Blueprint 6.2.0","version_number":"6.2.0","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-03T00:23:48.065781Z","downloads":1116,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"97687a8a006c61c198fb15a3a6194625390b7e12d831b7026f376b797546fa60efef014f313fc9ac028c103fead85e496bef10d8f8dae226cf4ff6564b22d53b","sha1":"5ca0f02b058e42d6dd33051e5b4b1d928b6b7e16"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/VsM5EDoI/versions/SnLXbWe9/blueprint-1.19.2-6.2.0.jar","filename":"blueprint-1.19.2-6.2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":992248,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"q5duvarF","username":"TeamAbnormals","name":"teamabnormals","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/q5duvarF/eba25e566c8678da285243ac416844c84dc7ef9d.png","bio":"We're a modding team dedicated to creating with high-quality art and design for modern Minecraft versions!","created":"2023-09-18T16:48:51.416757Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"3u8PgG8F","username":"bagel","name":"bagel","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/3u8PgG8F/3c735084680f47dea218cca869655cfc245cd051.png","bio":"minecraft modder and coder and yeaher","created":"2021-04-29T17:41:22.849292Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"nmCECwLn","user":{"id":"P53hwL9b","username":"SmellyModder","name":"Luke Tonon","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/P53hwL9b/02d85c2d067251dc276beec1c53ebf4ae05bcfb8.png","bio":"Software Developer, Game Developer, and Modder.\r\nMaking dreams come true.","created":"2023-09-18T18:52:46.978373Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"blueprint-1.19.2-6.2.0.jar"},"mods\\chalk-1.19.2-1.6.3.jar":{"sha512":"ecc42557ae2eb8a4b3d1ffdbf79282eca7c3c72cbdac69433130784411b4150a350a72e768f9d3a8963d9a370bb7113f78146ffdad641b50db1850a8dbc59534","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YWGP4Y1d","slug":"chalk-mod","project_type":"mod","team":"cBcxG29u","title":"Chalk","description":"You'll never lose your way again!","body":"<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XpqtuyD.png\" width=2000/>\n\n## Mark your way through the vast world of Minecraft®!\n \n### Chalk allows you to draw marks for easier navigation in the caves or structures.\n\n\n<img  src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qx2fgdp.png\" alt=\"Chalks\" width=1000/>\n<img  src=\"https://i.imgur.com/f43BLYS.png\" alt=\"Symbols\" width=1000/>\n<img  src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YfuLEeh.png\" alt=\"Glowing\" width=1000/>\n<img  src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FjhcKIR.png\" alt=\"Chalk Box\" width=1000/>\n\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yb5gsGmDugM\" title=\"YouTube Chalk Showcase\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Description in text form</summary>\n<h3>Chalks</h3>\n\n - Chalks come in all 16 Minecraft colors<br>\n - Crafted with a piece of Calcite and any dye.

Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Zvh47yt.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

integrate it with the Forge modding\necosystem.\n\nEmbeddium is **not supported by CaffeineMC**. Do not report issues encountered with it to their bug tracker or in their Discord. I have my own [Discord server](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) for my mods if you would like to discuss, provide suggestions, etc.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nGenerally Embeddium should work out of the box with many more mods than Rubidium. However, given the scope of changes\nit makes to the renderer, it may have compatibility issues with some mods that use advanced rendering. Please open an\nissue if you experience problems. Some issues may require changes to be made in the other mod but it's good to have\nthem documented.\n\nThe [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/wiki/Compatibility#known-incompatibilities) has a somewhat-maintained list of known incompatibilities.\n\n**OptiFine is not supported** for obvious reasons.\n\n## Shaders\n\nFor now, please continue to use [Oculus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oculus) if you want shader support.\nNote that Oculus is somewhat buggy, and your experience will probably be more stable without it. I recommend removing\nOculus if you do not need shaders.\n\n## Credits\n\n* JellySquid & the CaffeineMC team, for making Sodium in the first place, without which this project would not be possible\n* Asek3, for the initial port to Forge\n* XFactHD, for providing a list of gamebreaking Rubidium issues to start this work off, and for testing early builds\n* Pepper, for their invaluable assistance with getting Forge lighting to work on Sodium 0.5\n* CelestialAbyss and input-Here for making the new logo design\n\n## License\n\nPlease refer to the [LICENSE](https://github.com/embeddedt/embeddium/blob/16.x/forge/LICENSE) file.

No need for placing the whole box on the ground for checking contents or adding a few item stacks! When you want to extract an item, easily scroll through all items in the box to get what you want. And believe it or not, this works with Ender Chests, too!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2Nqc3go.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X0ssWwh-owo\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Shulker Boxes and Ender Chests are so damn useful for storing and transporting many items. But why do you always have to place them on the floor to use them? Time to change that!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In any interface, simply hold shift when hovering the container item and you'll <strong>see all of its contents</strong> in the item tooltip. And if you just quickly want to add a few items, simply <strong>right-click them on the box/chest item in your inventory</strong>. You can do the same without holding an item to <strong>extract items from a box/chest</strong>. To control which item you extract simply use the scrolling wheel to cycle through all the contents.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I

[1.19.2] EasyShulkerBoxes-v4.4.1","version_number":"v4.4.1-1.19.2-Forge","changelog":"# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog].\n\n## [v4.4.1-1.19.2] - 2023-05-30\n### Added\n- Added an optional slot definition where an item needs to be equipped for allowing inventory interactions\n### Removed\n- Removed default integration for the Backpacked mod, as preventing interactions when an item is placed in a custom slot (such as Backpacked's own slot, or Curios and Trinkets slots) is currently not supported\n\n## [v4.4.0-1.19.2] - 2023-05-17\n### Added\n- Added a fully data-driven system for defining support for Easy Shulker Boxes' features for any item using data packs\n  - This system allows users to manually add support for other mods (intended for backpack and shulker box mods, check out the documentation on GitHub)\n  - Default support is available for the following mods: Bag Of Holding (Forge+Fabric), Backpacked (Forge), Inmis (Fabric), Simple Backpack (Fabric), Reinforced Shulker Boxes (Fabric)\n  - Also note that mod support only works for the default config settings of those mods. When changing backpack sizes in a mod, you'll have to provide your own data pack to adjust the sizes for Easy Shulker Boxes\n- Added Precision Mode, hold the `Ctrl` key (`Cmd` on Mac) to activate, allows for extracting / inserting only a single item from a container item instead of all items from the selected slot\n  - In precision mode left-clicking inserts an item, and right-clicking extracts a single item, overriding vanilla mouse interactions\n  - The scroll wheel can also be used for quickly moving items\n  - Works great with the slot scrolling and item dragging features already present\n- Added a key to render the item tooltip for the currently carried stack to aid with using precision mode\n### Changed\n- Container item indicators (the small `+` shown when holding an item stack) now comes in different colors, showing if other stacks of the same item were found in the container\n### Fixed\n- Fixed bundle interactions not working on servers due to a required Mixin only being registered client-side\n- Fixed bundles still showing the vanilla tooltip image when empty\n- Fixed compatibility with Mouse Tweaks mod\n### Removed\n- Removed config options for turning off Easy Shulker Boxes' features for individual items, this is now controlled by data packs\n\n## [v4.3.7-1.19.2] - 2022-11-25\n### Added\n- Added item tooltips for maps (still wip)\n### Fixed\n- Fixed start-up crash on Forge due to an error in a mixin class\n\n## [v4.3.6-1.19.2] - 2022-11-25\n### Added\n- You can now drag your mouse over slots in an inventory to add all items in those slots to a shulker box/ender chest/bundle\n- The same works when dragging across empty slots to put the contents from the item you are carrying there\n### Changed\n- More background preparations to eventually allow for supporting modded items (like backpacks) with all the new item interactions\n### Fixed\n- Fixed the `+` indicator on ender chests not correctly showing when holding a shulker box\n- Tooltips for the currently selected item in another item's tooltip will no longer show even more tooltips if that selected item also has an inventory (basically prevents nesting)\n\n## [v4.3.5-1.19.2] - 2022-11-24\n### Added\n- The tooltip of the item currently selected in a container item's tooltip is now shown next to the main tooltip, so you can e.g. tell tools with different enchantments apart (very much inspired by the [Equipment Compare] mod)\n- Added full support for bundles, this means slot scrolling now works on those, so you can select the item you want to take out instead of always taking out the last one\n- Also, bundles have better looking tooltips\n- There still is no crafting recipe for bundles (yet) though, you'll have to deal with obtaining them yourself\n### Changed\n- Easy Shulker Boxes can now override inventory interactions and tooltip images for any item, even when it implements those features itself already (still all only accessible via the in-code api)\n- Uncolored shulker boxes have a fancy custom tooltip color\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a dupe glitch where the last item in a shulker box could be taken out indefinitely when interacting with the item\n\n## [v4.3.4-1.19.2] - 2022-11-23\n### Changed\n- For Easy Shulker Boxes to support an item it must now be manually registered, this means only vanilla items (shulker boxes, ender chests, bundles) will be supported by default, mainly to prevent larger shulker boxes from other mods from breaking\n- Other mods can manually register their content though for support\n- Tooltips now have a thicker border, so they look more pretty (actually had to redo most of that rendering code so this could work, oof)\n- Reverse tooltip scrolling direction\n- Ender Chests have a fancy custom tooltip color\n### Fixed\n- Fixed shulker box block entity data other than stored items being deleted when interacting with the item stack in your inventory (this ifx allows for compatibility with mods that e.g. add shulker box enchantments)\n### Removed\n- Removed bundle-like tutorial banners when using newly added item interactions for the first time\n\n## [v4.3.3-1.19.2] - 2022-10-22\n### Changed\n- When extracting an item from a shulker box/ender chest in an inventory menu via right-clicking the last item is no longer the one taken out first. Instead, use the scroll wheel to choose which item you want to take from the shulker box/ender chest.\n\n## [v4.3.2-1.19.2] - 2022-09-15\n### Fixed\n- Fixed compatibility with Numismatic Overhaul mod\n\n## [v4.3.1-1.19.2] - 2022-09-01\n### Added\n- Added a `+` indicator that is shown on shulker boxes, ender chests and bundles when the stack carried by the cursor can be added to them in your inventory\n\n## [v4.3.0-1.19.2] - 2022-08-21\n- Compiled for Minecraft 1.19.2\n- Updated to Puzzles Lib v4.2.0\n\n## [v4.2.1-1.19.1] - 2022-08-06\n### Fixed\n- Fixed Cardinal Components not being set as a proper dependency in `fabric.mod.json`\n\n## [v4.2.0-1.19.1] - 2022-08-06\n### Added\n- Inventory interactions and tooltips now work on ender chests\n- Added server config to disable individual interactions\n\n## [v4.1.0-1.19.1] - 2022-07-30\n- Compiled for Minecraft 1.19.1\n- Updated to Puzzles Lib v4.1.0\n\n## [v4.0.3-1.19] - 2022-07-13\n- Fully compatible with Forge 41.0.98+ which is also now required\n\n## [v4.0.2-1.19] - 2022-07-10\n### Changed\n- Added a check for the mod to only work on shulker boxes with a stack size of one to prevent item duplication with some mods that allow for empty shulker box items to stack (such as the Carpet mod)\n\n## [v4.0.1-1.19] - 2022-07-09\n### Changed\n- Slightly reduced mod loader specific code by moving some parts to Puzzles Lib \n\n## [v4.0.0-1.19] - 2022-07-06\n- Ported to Minecraft 1.19\n- Split into multi-loader project\n\n[Keep a Changelog]: https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/\n[Equipment Compare]:

📖\n\n<hr>\n</center>\n\nAd Astra! (translation: \"To the Stars!\") is a space mod for Fabric and Forge with a focus on technology, travel and\nexploration. We've got everything you need to become an astronaut: rockets, space suits, space stations and machines.\nWhy not take a stroll on the Moon? Build a self-sustaining bunker on Mars? Go mining on Venus? The entire Solar System,\nbetter yet, Milky Way, is at your disposal!\n\n- Five celestial bodies: The Moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury and Glacio, in two different solar systems. Each planet\n  expresses a distinctive flair, with specific mobs and unique materials.\n- Vehicles: Four rocket tiers for interplanetary travel and a rover for traversing the rough, alien terrain ahead.\n- Technology: Standard processing machines and generators, along with oxygen generation and distribution, fuel refining,\n  water pumping, cable, fluid pipes and a rocket workbench.\n- Building: Spruce up your builds with over 250 building blocks, ranging from planet-specific bricks and stones to space\n  station deco and metal plating.\n- An in-game guidebook, explaining everything you need to progress and prosper in Ad Astra!\n\n<center>\n<hr>\n\n[![Use code \"Terrarium\" for 25% off at

All leaves are gone after about one second (configurable). That's it, nothing special about it so far!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Why another leaf decay mod? Aren't there like a dozen already?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure, but this one is different for sure.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Out Of The Box Mod Compat:</strong> All mods that register their leaves in the <code>minecraft:leaves</code> tag are automatically supported, even when their leaves don't extend vanilla Minecraft's leaves block (e.g. some of the large trees in the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Terrestria</span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/coderbot\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">coderbot</span></a>).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>No Additional Block Updates/Block State Checks:</strong> Leaves Be Gone is extremely efficient when determining which leaves blocks to accelerate decay for. It hooks in just where vanilla decides when a leaves block is able to decay, so it doesn't have to do any calculations on it's own. Also no additional calculations are made elsewhere, like when harvesting logs or when other leaves blocks decay as in other mods.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Works Properly Across Chunk/Level Reloads:</strong> Scheduled leaf decays are stored using Minecraft's native system for scheduling ticks (no custom hacky solution required!), so when undloading and reloading the area leaf decay continues as it should without having to repeat any calculations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/813/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/814/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Redwood tree leaves be gone!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many drops!</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

It's because of the 8:1 block ratio between the Nether and the Overworld. It's really weird though that you enter a portal in the overworld, and then when going back through where you came, come out of a different portal in the overworld. This mod fixes that issue.\n\nIt keeps track of what portals a player went through in order to ensure correct destinations when the player is going back through the same portals. The 1:8 ratio remains, portals just get smarter and remember where you came from.\n\n## Features\n\n- As long as players use the same portal to return to the overworld, they will end up where they came from\n- Only needs to be installed on the server (but works in singleplayer as well)\n\n\n<p>\n    <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/netherportalfix_broken.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" /> \n    <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/netherportalfix_fixed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"256\" />\n</p>","published":"2022-06-14T21:48:05.255247Z","updated":"2023-09-27T06:56:03.257487Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":190495,"followers":199,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["W2GQFVWF","KchVyZcY","lvjIpOkl","8Z8NExgb","ermlUjF9","Xgt8gsvh","3ABQuZux","mZoHwPFg","jlARFVYj","609MPxvC","fAtDIamf","kpXZdI4d","b11QoY35","Aa31SP8V","wX5DuGY9","FNyz19JT","nGNVabdg","HXKeuKnk","5UbTkcSQ","aeJtHUBZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/nPZr02ET/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"kpXZdI4d","project_id":"nPZr02ET","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"10.0.1+forge-1.19","version_number":"10.0.1+forge-1.19","changelog":"- Fixed crash if mods change player dimension during spawn\n- Fixed random nether portals being spawned in their expected Vanilla locations even if players are returned to their return portal","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-02-26T13:27:52.142910Z","downloads":1559,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"67486a6a114025a42d75f741bfacb3a391a19b6a","sha512":"ee030317768340051f4a733bfd317fea7e6f39da6f628554fed7d22550b9d77d4be0e3a746849b581c23abb4e488c3dab5b199b961d1854da52af5429c4c245a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/nPZr02ET/versions/kpXZdI4d/netherportalfix-forge-1.19-10.0.1.jar","filename":"netherportalfix-forge-1.19-10.0.1.jar","primary":true,"size":216681,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"C60k8eYK","project_id":"MBAkmtvl","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"wvv5zQj8","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"netherportalfix-forge-1.19-10.0.1.jar"},"mods\\createaddition-1.19.2-1.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"88c6253ce155f8f7d9e75b56de03cd3c58d66929b70edc94ff4989d7e0f9b911281ea755fa8a6a9d73674d995c1b09abe3d40f74f3b2bfe182ebd5339d562cbe","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kU1G12Nn","slug":"createaddition","project_type":"mod","team":"gi4UGsOA","title":"Create Crafts & Additions","description":"Create Crafts & Additions extends Create and acts as a bridge between electricity and kinetic energy","body":"# Create Crafts & Additions\n### For Minecraft Forge 1.15.2, 1.16.4/5, 1.17.1, 1.18.1/2, 1.19.2, and 1.20.1\nThanks to community contributions, now also for Fabric 1.18.2, and 1.19.2\nWarning!

alt=\"wiki.gg\"></a>\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ About the Aether ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether Team presents the original Aether mod! Maintained and kept up to date for modern versions of Minecraft and fully compatible with multiplayer!\n\nThe Aether centers around a dimension high in the sky, filled with **vast skylands** of clouds and **floating islands**. This dimension features its own new survival adventure, based around a basic vanilla-esque **survival progression** that features **new ores**, **mythical mobs**, and **three perilous dungeons** each with their own **powerful loot items**.\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image0.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ What's in the Mod ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether consists of many new accessible features, most of which are explained in the original forum post for the [Aether Collaboration Mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275355-1-7-3-aether-collaboration-mod-v1-02-new-mobs). A brief overview of this content includes:\n* A Hostile Paradise in the sky: the Aether dimension! Just make sure not to fall off of it, or you’ll end up back in the Overworld.\n* A range of new blocks and items accessible from the dimension itself.\n* 3 utility blocks: The Altar, Freezer, and Incubator.\n* 4 material tiers: Skyroot, Holystone, Zanite, and Gravitite, each with their own tools and weapons with unique abilities.\n* The Book of Lore, complete with an entry for every block and item in the mod.\n* An accessory system that lets you utilize the loot you discover.\n* Mobs both reminiscent of the Overworld and unique to the Aether.\n* Moas: a flying mob mount with different tiers of differing jump counts.\n* 3 new structures to conquer: the Bronze, Silver, and Gold Dungeons, each with their own equipment to loot and bosses to defeat.\n* Eternal Day, only able to be ended once the final dungeon is conquered, then the day cycle can be controlled with a unique utility block: the Sun Altar.\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Getting Started ☁️</center></h2>\n\nTo get started with the Aether, you must construct a portal with a **Glowstone frame** and light it with a **water bucket** in the middle, this will activate the portal and allow you to step through and enter the dimension. From here you can begin your survival in the Aether’s hostile paradise!\n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image1.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Conquering Dungeons ☁️</center></h2>\n\nThe Aether's world contains three new mysterious dungeons, each with a fearsome boss to defeat...\n\nThe **Bronze Dungeon** is the home of the Sentries and guarded by the ominous **Slider**, a creature born of pure stone. Look out for hidden tunnels through islands and prepare yourself with the best gear you can craft!\n\nThe **Silver Dungeon** is the beautiful Valkyrie Temple. Challenge the knights of the Valkyrie Order and, if you prove worthy, fight the **Valkyrie Queen** herself. Utilize every tool and trick you can to best this ancient warrior. \n\nWithin the rare **Gold Dungeon** lies the **Sun Spirit**, an eternal being of pure fire and energy. He is the God that rules the very Sun itself and will take some convincing to even pay attention to a being such as yourself. But it is rumored he guards some of the best treasure that exists in the Aether.  \n\n<center><img src=\"https://github.com/The-Aether-Team/.github/blob/main/images/image2.png?raw=true\"></center>\n<br>\n\n<h2><center>☁️ Join the Conversation ☁️</center></h2>\n\nCome join our Discord server to chat with a growing community of over 10,000 members!\n\nHave a question for the developers?

why baby zombies are a thing, but baby skeletons are nowhere to be found? Wonder no more, <strong>Tiny Skeletons</strong> is here to change just that. A baby variant is added for normal skeletons, strays, and wither skeletons. And they all have unique behaviors to stand out from their adult variants.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jclQJHc.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The new baby skeleton variants spawn just like baby zombies; every time an adult skeleton spawn, there is a chance of 5% it's baby counterpart will spawn instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Baby Skeletons</strong> are true combat masters. When hunting a target, they'll use their bow for ranged combat. As soon as they come close enough, they'll quickly switch to the wooden sword on their back, and turn to melee combat. All this together with their quick movement speed makes them quite the challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Baby Strays</strong> on the other hand don't inherit the bows from their adult variant. They're equipped with snowballs instead, and will throw those right in your face whenever they have the chance. But be careful, they are quite the tiny jerks: Their snowballs have pebbles mixed in, so they'll deal a very tiny amount of damage on impact.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Last but not least, <strong>Baby Wither Skeletons</strong> are very different from their adult variant. Instead of being aggressive and hunting you down, they're scared you'll steal the wither skeleton skull they carry and will try to flee as soon as you get even a little bit close. But if you manage to corner one and kill it there is a grand reward: You'll be guaranteed to receive that skull! But doesn't that break the balance for obtaining wither skeleton skulls? No, it doesn't, as baby wither skeletons are quite rare. It's just, that when you find one and are able to hunt it down, you'll have a guaranteed wither skeleton skull. You want to get those valuable wither skeleton skulls, but don't want to kill those cute little creatures? Just give them a wither rose, they'll no longer be scared of you and drop the skull they are carrying for you to collect.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jclQJHc.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/409/174/2021-11-20_18.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/409/175/2021-11-20_18.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Adult skeleton and baby skeleton in a village</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Baby skeletons can quickly switch to the sword carried on their back</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/409/176/2021-11-20_18.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/409/177/2021-11-20_18.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Baby strays ready to throw some snowballs in your face</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Baby wither skeletons holding their precious skulls</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jclQJHc.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Tiny Skeletons doesn't offer any configuration on it's own. The only thing you can modify is the rate at which skeletons will be replaced by their baby variants. This is controlled by the baby chance option in the Forge server config. To edit Forge's server config, install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support. For Fabric it depends on Cloth Config, for Forge it will use the default Forge config system in the backend.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

[FancyMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/fancymenu)\n\n### Fabric\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (Only for Fabric)\n\n## About \n\nThe audio extension for FancyMenu allows you to add audio elements to your layouts!\n\nAudio elements are highly customizable and have some very nice features:\n- Add multiple sounds per audio element, to let them play as playlist\n- Use the index of sounds in an audio element to change their order or set the same index to multiple sounds to let them play in random order/shuffle mode\n- Set the MC audio channel of audio elements (master, music, etc.)\n- Set the base volume of sounds in audio elements, to adjust sound volumes individually\n- Set audio elements to loop\n- Let audio elements only play once per session\n- Toggle-mute a specific audio element by using the 'toggle_mute_audio' button action\n\nTo use this extension, just install it along with FancyMenu and you're ready to vibe!\n\n\n## Bug Reports and Requests\n\nYou can report bugs and request features either on [GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/FancyMenu-Audio-Extension) or via [Discord](https://discord.gg/UzmeWkD)!\n\n## Modpacks\n\nYou can freely use this mod in

Slicer\n\nThis mod enables a variety of features to create better compatibility between mostly [Farmer's Delight][FARMERS_DELIGHT_FORGE] and [Create][CREATE_FORGE].\nWhile it is designed to work with Farmer's Delight, it does work without it and also adds some compatibility features for other mods.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/slicer.png)\n\n### Automatic Cutting\n\nThe Main feature of the mod is the _Slicer_, a machine similar to the _Mechanical Mixer_ or _Mechanical Press_ from Create.\nIt automatically registers all cutting recipes from Farmer's Delight. In that sense, it is an automatic _Cutting Board_.  \nIn order to use it, the correct tool has to be placed into the machine, using `Right-Click`.\nBy default, only knives and axes are allowed, but this behaviour can be overwritten by modifying the `sliceanddice:allowed_tools` item tag.\nAn example datapack which adds shears to this tag can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/raw/1.20.x/example_datapack.zip)\n\n### Automatic Cooking\n\nAll recipes from Farmer's delight requiring the Cooking Pot are added as heated mixing recipes.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/cooking.png)\n\n### Sprinkler\n\nThe Sprinkler is a block which, when provided with a fluid using a pipe, will distribute it in a small area below.  \nDifferent fluids can have different effects.\n\n- Lava applies a small amount of fire damage to entities below\n- Water makes the area below wet, making the world think it's raining there.\n- Potions apply their affect for a short duration to entities below\n- Liquid Fertilizer, a new fluid, applies a bonemeal affect to blocks.\n\nThe latter is meant to enable growing of _Banana Fonds_ from [Neapolitan][NEAPOLITAN] without being dependent on the weather, but it could possibly have other effects on other mods too.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/sprinkler.png)\n\n### Overweight Farming\n\nIf present, some compatibility features for [Overweight Farming][OVERWEIGHT_FARMING] is added.  \nThis includes waxing recipes using the deployer,\nas well as showing the axe-stripping of overweight crops in JEI.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/strip.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/wax.png)\n","published":"2022-08-14T17:09:40.957018Z","updated":"2023-09-22T07:59:41.249837Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":82916,"followers":206,"categories":["food","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["UJTc0pk2","1wP6CNfI","Nk2dO6Go","KriL1JFW","r4yDHtFN","tA385l8n","JH33REuT","tZZRCOac","lXNFlrvW","OIhe0uO4","ZmhTpjLR","pRwBOCJc","gCGCFJis","hPDyRNw3","lrslRK8c","fGG0Gjcv","mG1fIOia","akAH2F1g","89gCgL8n","FF8UA0pu","LfIs9gRN","PmCarZvQ","BZLiJ13y","O8bSqUaV","sGqyWl93","U9GIWHMX","uv6f7FCw","t8iOd0XR","7HTroPJk","kvrLbSxC","1aTrUinS","qWFV16cD","3wyhfJQQ","vd7c2RPJ","mTr2nUPj","t3lFXxzY","aRK21L9m","qaNqtys9","nkNOsYBR","rYnuEPwn","tAgVGTaW","s9l4uqVE","IlpHtI0z","ZEitGVtL","73nfCddX","etRuKHcg","yZ9zZESN","giM4WleV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/9af7f38727e4c1dc30c67fefd80b15000a2b8c07.png"},"version":{"id":"IlpHtI0z","project_id":"GmjmRQ0A","author_id":"qxswSLtS","featured":false,"name":"Forge 2.3.2","version_number":"2.3.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\n* make farmer's delight dough an option tag entry\n* Update ru_ru.json by @VGamerGroup\n* Added ko_kr.json by @AsseyGithub","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-06T14:16:51.933742Z","downloads":3452,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"539ed8f344fe59c82a14493b74fa61a0d1683b95","sha512":"32acc9e4ba06e0fe77f9e5c46efb4aa8d93cc48a690051bec7cac27a7ff07c7e74228ff809370dd36df5a10dba7ccd6ee00b5fc43fdb1f5e147c7dfa4d6bfa53"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/versions/IlpHtI0z/sliceanddice-forge-2.3.2.jar","filename":"sliceanddice-forge-2.3.2.jar","primary":true,"size":222195,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"LNytGWDc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"R2OftAxM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ordsPcFz","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"l7tsXKAD","user":{"id":"qxswSLtS","username":"possible_triangle","name":"Possible Triangle","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12880806?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-06-13T20:35:57.654377Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sliceanddice-forge-2.3.2.jar"},"mods\\Quark-3.4-418.jar":{"sha512":"716a0b27b62c8870aceb11ef3c5a44d479d700b14163e6f5e52d3e4d380659e49d07971d4502f68f20fc0477cb5bb94f69abab0ca862b6952d9e58985b7ca953","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"qnQsVE2z","slug":"quark","project_type":"mod","team":"I6Wr0Rge","title":"Quark","description":"A Quark is a very small thing.

In simpler terms, it's a large mod with lots of small features, aimed at improving the vanilla game. \nEvery feature can be turned on and off individually at your will, and most features contain further options to tweak the game just how you like it.\n\nWith quark installed, the title screen will get a new \"q\" button added to it. This button allows you to configure quark from inside the game, so you can easily turn off any features you don't vibe with.\n\n---\n\n# Features\n\nQuark has over a hundred different modules to play with, but here's a small highlight reel of our favorites:\n\n* Feeding Trough, for automatic animal breeding\n* Pistons Push Tile Entities, just like in Bedrock Edition\n* Japanese and Industrial style building blocks\n* Variant versions for Bookshelves, Chests, and Ladders for all wood types\n* Vertical Slabs, for all slabs already in the base game and Quark\n* Advanced Camera Mode for fancy screenshots\n* Toretoises, typo intended - new underground animals that grow ore on their back\n* Pickarang, a pickaxe that can be thrown as a boomerang\n* Trowel, a new tool to place random blocks from your hotbar, for paths or ruins\n* Emote system, allowing your character to do all sorts of motions from the chat menu\n* Reacharound Placing, which lets you place blocks under other blocks without being able to see the bottom face\n* Azalea Wood, replacing the Oak wood in Azalea trees with a pleasant green\n* Glimmering Weald, a new rare deep underground biome with glowing mushrooms and a cute new stone fae mob\n\nAnd many, many more!\n\n---\n\n# Learn more about Quark today\n### Visit the **[Official Website](https://quarkmod.net/)**\n\n* Visit the [Old Website](https://quarkmod.net/old) (for Minecraft versions 1.12 and prior)\n* Check out [what changed](https://vazkii.notion.site/Quark-3-0-Forge-1-18-Release-Notes-f22ef705b677421585f1208156a82b44) between Quark for 1.16 and Quark for 1.18\n* Download [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities), an addon focusing on more complex and technical features\n\n---\n\n\n\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/support.png)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/patreon.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/store.png)](https://store.vazkii.net)\n[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/ch.png)](https://violetmoon.org/creeperhost)","published":"2022-11-13T03:56:40.716482Z","updated":"2023-10-22T22:46:28.367333Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":90897,"followers":287,"categories":["game-mechanics","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.9.4"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["hUHoJ8IU","DWIopZ9p","z07wlDPM","MPJKDJmI","etJaVjwR","LQATRjJy","WVcMK697","e4xifKGM","NBd2DS3z","aLMcsDgH","KnCaeyy6","dNfuCJua","LrasAC1d","kDj0Fa7f","ywSMRT9e","kYMyxgpY","JThLxL7g","L9PRqT3G","Y5dUVG07","jchiLv3T","J2ikYge8","hxZ3rlaJ","4JhlPAZH","kGwG7wZ9","XV6IcdSU","ieBJd6v7","lYGV9kJO","NRZpkg7a","c7hTFL3Q","Nhn8Fatv","9ihQgCxD","qNOl7hL2","JXifdD4Q","SabfrHOJ","Vjf1btuB","8B3wEsDO","zyvZoGBo","l56EicrO","QipVljYx","htdpIhCQ","stYFI7Km","Bz5rycUV","2y7uLplb","nYJW7kfd","mxjAPHWr","ZqUi5HxP","M1mbFwiX","8po5DGR8"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/64151f8964bc6b81d968e814bf7344bbdfad27d0.png"},"version":{"id":"8po5DGR8","project_id":"qnQsVE2z","author_id":"kRXgk5E1","featured":false,"name":"1.19.2-3.4-418","version_number":"1.19.2-3.4-418","changelog":"https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark/releases/tag/release-1.19.2-3.4-418","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T22:46:30.469397Z","downloads":4457,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"716a0b27b62c8870aceb11ef3c5a44d479d700b14163e6f5e52d3e4d380659e49d07971d4502f68f20fc0477cb5bb94f69abab0ca862b6952d9e58985b7ca953","sha1":"3d4bf7bf166b3f30f74100e91d6760fbd93e660f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qnQsVE2z/versions/8po5DGR8/Quark-3.4-418.jar","filename":"Quark-3.4-418.jar","primary":true,"size":15024651,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"NvZ9ZhwE","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"nxIuTMRv","username":"GoesBySully","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/nxIuTMRv/f4400aa9bc0120732ae57903fab324e986e726f7.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-29T12:53:22.188525Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"kRXgk5E1","username":"Vazkii","name":"Vasco Lavos","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794735?v=4","bio":"holy hell","created":"2022-11-13T03:09:41.900759Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"I6Wr0Rge","user":{"id":"BU21lLGA","username":"MehVahdJukaar","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24719182?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-21T07:42:29.648721Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Quark-3.4-418.jar"}},"modrinth_update_version":null}
